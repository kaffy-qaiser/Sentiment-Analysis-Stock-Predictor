I finally locked in some profit on the calls today.

Every single dollar from driving Uber at night went into more calls in TSLA.

Will take a really good rest this weekend.

Probably get back to the game next week or even before market-close today.

thanks

Peloton got done bad CMV,"**I have no open positions in PTON, this is purely a discussion NOT a recommendation.**

I could be way off base here, I've barely looked into them. I've pretty much ignored the stock since the pandemic. If anyone has any counter-arguments I'd love to hear them.

The total accidents from the  PTON treadmill (as far as I can find, open to more info) is 70 with 1 reported death. The bikes that had a recall had 35 reports of seat post breaking, and 13 reports of injuries dude to FALLING from the bike. And apparently 1 guy died some how by an artery laceration. I just wanted to start a discussion on PTON and where they're at in terms of their accident recalls. I've not looked deep into the stock (yet) so I'm definitely wanting to go deeper here. It seems really stupid to me, tbh. Obviously some rear protection should be there but I've seen PLENTY of treadmills without them.

These accidents can happen with **ANY BRAND** of equipment like this. We do not live in a bubble, things CAN and DO hurt you if misused. This includes not accounting for PETS and CHILDREN and having that back exposed. It's pure negligence on the users part. Treadmills injure THOUSANDS of people every year. Treadmills are the most common equipment involved in gym injuries. They are naturally an unsafe machine if not used properly. A quick search shows 22k emergency room visits alone from treadmills in 2019.

As I said, YES they should have put a rear-protection. YES they probably should have responded to the original issue with a bit more grace, but I see where they were coming from. Since then there have been further reasons for the steady decline but it mostly all stemmed from this incident.

**This is not a Peloton focus but treadmills in general.**

Further, can we not as a human race understand that a ***TREAD*** on a ***MILL*** is going to gain traction on anything it grips and pull it in its current direction? Can we as a human race deduce that MAYBE we should be aware of this and put the back to a wall? Like how I literally have my treadmill?

Not trying to sound insensitive to those who lost a pet or child, just saying...sometimes you have to look for the dangers yourself. Be proactive. Again, companies should be liable and correct areas that have room for injury, but we have to take responsbility for the safety of our homes. Dangers are all over every one of our houses (outlets, stove tops, fireplaces, lighters, matches, chemicals, etc) but we have to WORK AROUND those dangers and try to prevent.",1720190116.0,open positions pton purely discussion recommendation could way base barely looked pretty much ignored stock since pandemic anyone counter arguments love hear total accidents pton treadmill far find open info 70 1 reported death bikes recall 35 reports seat post breaking 13 reports injuries dude falling bike apparently 1 guy died artery laceration wanted start discussion pton terms accident recalls looked deep stock yet definitely wanting go deeper seems really stupid tbh obviously rear protection seen plenty treadmills without accidents happen brand equipment like live bubble things hurt misused includes accounting pets children back exposed pure negligence users part treadmills injure thousands people every year treadmills common equipment involved gym injuries naturally unsafe machine used properly quick search shows 22k emergency room visits alone treadmills 2019 said yes put rear protection yes probably responded original issue bit grace see coming since reasons steady decline mostly stemmed incident peloton focus treadmills general human race understand tread mill going gain traction anything grips pull current direction human race deduce maybe aware put back wall like literally treadmill trying sound insensitive lost pet child saying sometimes look dangers proactive companies liable correct areas room injury take responsbility safety homes dangers every one houses outlets stove tops fireplaces lighters matches chemicals etc work around dangers try prevent,-0.8272,2024-07-05
üö®$BA plea deal decision day - ‚òÑÔ∏è or üí©? ,"Today‚Äôs the day! Boeing has until the end of the day to accept or reject the DOJ's plea deal over the 737 Max crashes. Here's what we're looking at:

- DOJ Deal: $200M fine, 3 years probation, and an independent monitor.
- Victims' Families: Calling it a ""sweetheart deal"" and pushing for a trial.

Here‚Äôs the lowdown:

- Reputation: Can Boeing shake off this PR disaster, or is their brand forever tainted? Are we talking Titanic-level sinking, or can they pull a Houdini?
- Financials: Will the fine and potential legal battles sink their ship, or do they have the cash reserves to weather this storm?
- Stock Price: Will accepting the deal bring stability and investor confidence, or will the backlash make $BA nosedive? If they reject it, are we looking at courtroom drama that could send the stock into freefall?

NVIDIA is not a AI Company nor a Graphics Company,"They are a research company with 60% profitability.

Have you ever seen HOW MANY research papers NVIDIA publish in a year?

[Publications | Research (nvidia.com)](https://research.nvidia.com/publications)

  
It is in the HUNDEREDS. They are publishing more papers per year than most of the universities around the globe.

Can you still not comprehend how FAST their tech is advancing?

Let's check how is AMD doing? [AMD Research - Publications | AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/research/publications.html)

They published 8 papers in 2022. Meanwhile NVIDIA published MORE THAN 100.

And if you have any academic background in Computer Science or Computer Engineering, you will know that how frequent you will pop into a NVIDIA research for your studies.

This also shows us why their products are superiour and at least two generations ahead of their competition.

And this also shows us that why they will BUILD on that lead. Recent Blackwell announcement is also a hint on that. They are selling Datacenters costing MILLIONS of dollars per unit.

Personally I think that NVIDIA will reach 5T market cap in 2 years, and 10T market cap in 5 years.

"Of course you realize, this means arbitrage! $LSXMK & $LSXMA","tl;dr - Everyone is focused on the old tech and ignoring the free money. The trade is not about satellite radio or streaming apps, the trade is about buying $1 with 77¬¢.

# This trade is not about satellite radio.

Please understand that.

Every time this subject comes up it devolves into discussion about the future of satellite radio and which streaming app is best.  That's not the idea here.

If you want to buy SIRI (or hold it) when we're done that's another story.  (I'll include info on why you might in the comments.  I'm sure we can all supply reasons to be bearish.)

This is a short term trade involving two Liberty Media tickers.

The tickers are LSXMA and LSXMK (I may refer to them as LSXM- when I'm saying something that applies equally to both.)

# [Sometime ""early this quarter"" every share of LSXM- is going to transform into 8.4 shares of SIRI.](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/522/liberty-media-and-siriusxm-announce-transaction-to-simplify)

(Since I just mentioned SIRI let me once again remind you that this trade is not about satellite radio or Pandora.)

[SIRI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIRI/) closed at $3.53 on 3 July.  Since the market is always efficient that means that LSXM- closed at exactly $29.65.  [(3.53 \* 8.4 = 29.65)](https://www.google.com/search?q=3.53+*+8.4&sca_esv=2d68b74fb50c3936&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ADLYWILAeAJ-xqtGbSMANonf0EQ3A2O5Jg%3A1720124639171&ei=3wSHZvGWCpD-ptQPkPSmmAc&ved=0ahUKEwixgtnQm46HAxUQv4kEHRC6CXMQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=3.53+*+8.4&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCjMuNTMgKiA4LjRIvQ9QxQFY7QtwAXgAkAEAmAFeoAGEBaoBATi4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgGgAlnCAgUQIRifBZgDAIgGAZIHATGgB-4E&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)

Right?

The price is always right. Right?

Wrong.

[LSXMA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LSXMA/) closed at $22.76.  [LSXMK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LSXMK/) closed at $22.84.  How far off is that from where it should be?

[(22.80 / 29.65 =  0.77)](https://www.google.com/search?q=22.80+%2F+29.65&sca_esv=2d68b74fb50c3936&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ADLYWIIlQrnpMpoJvmMQlhXX3Iod7b7QOQ%3A1720124643574&ei=4wSHZoreIvGxptQPvbCZsAQ&ved=0ahUKEwjK2-XSm46HAxXxmIkEHT1YBkYQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=22.80+%2F+29.65&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDTIyLjgwIC8gMjkuNjVIqxdQ5QRY-BFwAXgAkAEAmAFSoAGuBaoBATm4AQPIAQD4AQL4AQGYAgCgAgCYAwCIBgGSBwCgB5AF&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)

LSXM- is trading at a 23% discount compared to its value in SIRI shares.

If SIRI holds at $3.53 and you own LSXM-, you can sell it all on the day the shares convert for a 23% profit.  If SIRI rises by the time of the conversion you'll make more.  If it falls by then you'll make less. << *This is  oversimplified*

I suspect it will hold or rise.

I'll leave my reasons for that in my comment below so we can skip the ""Howard Stern is sus"" comments (he definitely is, that's his schtick), the ""I can't afford a car with a radio"" comments (no shame in that, cars are expensive) and get to picking apart this play.

# Part two: the options are calling.

For some reason LSXM- has been ignored compared to SIRI, and that includes its option chain.

[Take a look at the IV on SIRI calls for Aug 16.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIRI/options/?type=calls&date=1723766400)

I picked that date because it's the middle of the quarter and the deal should be done by then or at least close enough that arbitrageurs are closing the gap.  At the time of writing the ATM calls are showing 99% IV.

[Now look at LSXMK calls for the same date.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIRI/options/?type=calls&date=1723766400)

At the time of writing the IV for ATM calls is 52% and the last sold price is $1.25.  **But wait! What's truly ATM right now?** The price of LSXMK or the price of (SIRI \* 8.4)? If the latter, then the true ATM strike is $29 and the last sold price is 10¬¢.

When those shares convert you'll be holding ATM calls on SIRI with a lot size of 840 shares and a cost basis of 10¬¢ per share.

If you think the merger will take longer to complete or that SIRI may be worth owning after the discount then the leaps may be an even better deal.

[Here are the LSXMK calls for Jan '25.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LSXMK/options/?type=calls&date=1737072000)

The $28 strike last sold for 55¬¢ with an IV of 57%.  But that gives you almost 5X the amount of time to figure out what to do with it plus $1 lower strike.

Given the time he started buying I think arbitrage is exactly what he had in mind.  The stocks have dropped since then.  Maybe they will buy more since the discount has opened up again, maybe they have all they want.  I don't know.

SoftBank in talks to get its hands on large volumes of Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs: Report,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/softbank-in-talks-to-get-its-hands-on-large-volumes-of-nvidias-gpus-report-3508499

Does the good news with this company ever stop?

Anyway, key point of the article imo:

_The latest move appears to be a part of CEO Masayoshi Son‚Äôs broader plan to position SoftBank as a leader in AI technology, for which it has started discussions with banks about borrowing money to fund up to $10 billion in energy-related projects driven by AI demand, The Information reported on Thursday._

And then this little nugget which is an entirely new concept to me for banks:

_SoftBank, a backer of companies like Tencent, T Mobile, 10x Genomics (NASDAQ:TXG), and Automation Anywhere, among others, could look to create a special-purpose company to purchase the GPUs with borrowed funds, and would then lease the GPUs to SoftBank, allowing the firm to keep the debt off its balance sheet._

Bullish argument for $Dell after Wednesday's rise and fall,"Dell got added to Bank of America's US 1 list
Wednesday and the stock jumped pre market and in the morning all the way to 149. Later in the day it crashed back down to reality and actually finished the day down despite the market rising overall. I don't understand the reason for the drop and think it could present a buying opportunity for all the same reasons BOA said. It has potential to be an S&P 500 addition and could see a nice boost in revenue (and hopefully margins) this quarter from their Al servers/computer sales. I've been talking about Dell a lot since their last earnings caused the stock to dive and finally thought my analysis was being realized until it wasn't. Would appreciate any thoughts as I'm still pretty new to this.

Nvidia to make $12bn from AI chips in China this year despite US controls,"Paywall-removed version for the poors (including myself) below. You know, in case any berrs still had an ounce of hope after the Nancy news.

https://www.ft.com/content/b76ef55b-21cd-498b-ac16-5660908bb8d2

_Nvidia is on course to sell $12bn worth of artificial intelligence chips in China this year despite US export controls that have throttled its business in one of the world‚Äôs biggest semiconductor markets.
The $3tn Silicon Valley group will over the coming months deliver more than 1mn of its new H20 chips, which are designed to fall outside of US restrictions on selling AI processors to Chinese customers, according to analyst forecasts._

_That figure is almost twice as many as Huawei is expected to sell of its China-made rival product, Ascend 910B, according to estimates from SemiAnalysis, a chip consultancy._

_Nvidia is the latest Silicon Valley company to find itself entangled in tensions between Washington and Beijing. The Biden administration wants to stem the flow of the world‚Äôs most powerful chips to China, fearing Beijing may use them to create more powerful AI systems with military applications._

_The resulting shortage of AI chips has hit the ability of Chinese tech groups such as ByteDance, Tencent and Alibaba to compete with US-based OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and Google in a technology that is reshaping the industry._

_Each H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting that Nvidia is likely to generate upwards of $12bn in sales. That would be more than the $10.3bn revenue made from its entire China business ‚Äî including selling graphics chips to PC gamers and other products ‚Äî in the financial year ending in January 2024._

_Nvidia declined to comment on the forecasts. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.
Ever since the Biden administration first introduced restrictions on Nvidia‚Äôs ability to sell its most powerful AI chips in China in 2022, the US company has warned that its business would suffer as cloud computing providers and AI start-ups there turned to local alternatives such as Huawei._

_‚ÄúOur business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past,‚Äù Jensen Huang, Nvidia‚Äôs chief executive, said during the company‚Äôs most recent earnings call in May. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs a lot more competitive in China now, because of the limitations on our technology‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚ÄâHowever, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there.‚Äù
Colette Kress, Nvidia‚Äôs finance chief, said on the same call that revenue from its data centre segment ‚Äî which includes AI chips ‚Äî in China in the latest quarter was ‚Äúdown significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October‚Äù._

_As recently as 2021, before the US began imposing export controls, China accounted for more than a quarter of Nvidia‚Äôs total revenues. Even if the H20 chip sells as well as analysts expect, China could be closer to 10 per cent of sales this year. But that also reflects the huge growth that Nvidia is seeing from US tech companies as they build out ever-larger AI systems._

_Although Nvidia‚Äôs sales in China have been lower ahead of the rollout of the new H20 this spring, analysts at both Morgan Stanley and SemiAnalysis say that the chip is now being shipped in volume and is proving popular with Chinese customers, despite its downgraded performance compared with the chips Nvidia can sell in the US._

_‚ÄúBuyers report positive feedback on the potential competitiveness of H20 clusters,‚Äù Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note to clients this week, pointing to ‚Äústrong China demand‚Äù._

 TSLA and deliverables: Elon and his history of polished products.,"Let me start by saying I love the IDEA of Tesla. Back in 2016-2017 when they announced the Model 3, a beautiful, eco-friendly electric car that was affordable, I was so excited and wanted to put in a pre-order despite not knowing the full cost.

Lo and behold, there were delays.

When FSD was hyped, and the concept of fully autonomous driving was the main selling point, it reignited my enthusiasm. Over a 6 years later (1) autonomous cars still require attentiveness and are far from the ‚Äúcar drive themselves‚Äù level promised by Musk, even with massive amounts of investment, programmers etc. at his disposal at the time (he has since significantly reduced his work force). What‚Äôs worse is he has removed LiDAR, and believes you just need eyes and a brain‚Ä¶ yet any basic science undergraduate can tell you the difference between the macula vs peripheral vision, and draw a simple analogy between cameras and LiDAR. A choice, I think, was a mistake.

He unveiled smart summon, a pretty amazing feature in theory, and fundamental to robotaxi, but it seems even Tesla owners don‚Äôt use it because it is buggy (2). Which may be a hint at how far off autonomous ride hailing could be‚Äî competitors like Waymo, which are solely focused on this technology have advanced considerably but not making such bold claims it seems, because they are grounded in reality. Bugs, glitches, and a lack of true intuitive humanness/user experience (3).

That leaves us with Robotaxi and Optimus. No doubt these are *in theory* incredible advancements, but what timeline, in reality, should we expect for these? Will the world be massively disappointed yet again? Or is this the turning point for TSLA and its ability to live up to its lofty ambitions? 

TL;DR
Elon will always have a reach further than his grasp. Are we just getting jerked around?

Just Do It and Buy Some NKE Calls,"Yes, I know the metallic taste lingers in everyone's mouth from the recent earnings decline. While this downturn may have impacted your portfolio, I believe the current bottom floor is an excellent opportunity. I honestly think this could be the biggest trading opportunity this year.

First things first: Nike has faced a few obstacles that need to be addressed. Nike's expected revenue fell short in Q4 2024, coming in at $12.6 billion compared to $12.9 billion. The 2% year-over-year decline is driven by an 8% drop in direct-to-consumer sales (Nike-owned stores). This decline, paired with less-than-ideal guidance, dampened investor spirits, leaving us with NKE at a price **unseen since 2020**. Rarely do we see a blue-chip stock present an entry opportunity like this. The best part? We have a worldwide marketing event beginning in 22 days. **Hence, I believe this is an ideal position to springboard towards 50x, perhaps even 100x profits**.

Nike is an elite shoe and sportswear company. The market overreacted to EPS reports and oversold. Now, we can take advantage of the largest single-day drop in the company's history to secure an excellent position. Nike isn't going anywhere. While Hoka and ON footwear are currently outperforming Nike, the latter remains head and shoulders above these companies. Nike boasts half a century of experience in this industry and is known for continuous innovation with products like Flyknit, Air Max, and React. The company has a significant global presence, reaching over 190 countries, and extends its influence beyond sports into popular culture through high-profile endorsements and sponsorships. This global influence is what I believe will yield the most profits.

The Summer Olympics are around the corner: July 26 - August 11. Nike has long been a prominent sponsor and supplier of the event, dating back to 1972. This enhances its global visibility and prestige. Comparing Nike to Hoka, ON, or even Lululemon is like comparing Coke to Dr. Pepper. You will never see these companies come close to replacing a giant like Nike in sponsoring major global events. Historically, Nike's stock has responded positively to the Olympics due to increased brand exposure and elite athletic association. Specifically, with every NKE earnings release preceding a major sporting event, the stock declined 75% of the time. Before the 2012 London Olympics, Nike shares fell 9%. Before 2008 Beijing? Yep, fell 10%. During and after the Olympics, we can expect to see positive movement. As such, I believe a price target of $90 is reasonable. This will boost investor confidence and transform this challenging period into a golden opportunity.

Bitcoin dropped to the 200 day moving average on the 1day period chart. It's up from here. ,"Bitcoin and many other cryptos and stocks go through cycles of dropping down and hitting their moving averages And cycling through the common moving average Periods.p 1 minute 5 minutes 30 minutes half hour 1 hour 1 day and 1 week ect.  That's why the dips get bigger as they go because they fall to bigger moving averages. This one was falling to the 200 day moving average on the 1 day period chart  After it Cycled through all the other common smaller moving averages making the smaller dips . As the crypto grew  It dipped down to previous smaller moving averages in order such as the 100 day was the previous dip and 50 day was the dip before that. Et cetera.  In my opinion it should be done now that it hit it. And then it will cycle through all of the Moving average periods again as it rises and this time the final big dip will be when it falls to the 200 day moving average on the 1 week chart. That will be the big crash at the end of the bull market.  That's just my opinion and not advice. I seem to see this pattern roughly in many charts but who knows I could be crazy. LOL

AI already uses as much energy as a small country and this is only the beginning.,"In January, the International Energy Agency (IEA) issued its forecast for global energy use over the next two years. Included for the first time were projections for electricity consumption associated with data centers, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence.

This usage represented almost 2 percent of global energy demand in 2022 ‚Äî and that demand for these uses could double by 2026, which would make it roughly equal to the amount of electricity used by the entire country of Japan.

We live in the digital age, where many of the processes that guide our lives are hidden from us inside computer code. We are watched by machines behind the scenes that bill us when we cross toll bridges, guide us across the internet, and deliver us music we didn‚Äôt even know we wanted. All of this takes material to build and run ‚Äî plastics, metals, wiring, water ‚Äî and all of that comes with costs.

As the world heats up toward increasingly dangerous temperatures and with governments agreeing on net zero targets we should be able to capitalise on a market that I think will be probably booming relatively soon.

We should look at companies with strong fundamentals and well positioned to gain access to a market that is definitely going to become massively profitable.

Everybody Uses $LIF. My BULL Thesis,"**Story**

I have been using $LIF since 2020 because my 3 siblings used it and wanted me to share locations with them. It wasn't really on my mind since I didn't trade back then but come to 2023 when I'm in freshman year of college, every person is using it other than find my iPhone for locations. Life360 seems to be the most applicable app for location sharing among families or friends due to it being available on both Android and Apple. When the IPO occurred I talked to my sister who is still in highschool if she likes life360 and she told me she bought the premium subscription for it. Therefore leading me to my bull thesis and deeper due diligence.

**Fundamentals**

The balance sheet if looking back since 2020 seems pretty strong with cash and equivalents being greater than the total debt, therefore meaning won't go bust in the face of economic downturn. The total assets were also increasing since 2020 up to 2023 along with the debt decreasing or coming back to about what is was in 2020 in 2023.

The losses are decreasing yoy, the revenue from both service and hardware is increasing yoy,¬†and therefore the losses are shrinking yoy.

I have discovered while doing my research that LIF owns Tile and Jiobit. Tile seems to be around a lot if you look for them while talking to people. Their brand isn't just the app but also physical products as well which shows they are expanding.

**Technical**

The trend beings displayed is upwards in the daily charts.

https://preview.redd.it/9e2nhvmiydad1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eb90c7709012738173941964402e0026da58f33

**Narrative**

Based on my readings about Peter Lynch's trading ideology and the idea of narrative economics by Robert J. Shiller, here is my narrative.

People in my daily life are using life360 all around me and I see their products in people's wallets and keys. Even I use the products they have and my sister buys their subscription service. My girlfriends whole family uses it as well. In a quick summary, everybody uses it and people who didn't use it are starting to because it is a ""trend."" This seems to fit the ideology about having a good story by Peter Lynch.

However, to add more on to this; there is way more to the narrative. The trend has already started and people are willing to pay for a free app to get more benefits out of it and a lot of times guys who use it or never used it don't really care about it. What is one thing every guy will do as they get older of just live? They will start dating and getting partners. Along with a growing want for safety with location sharing, the girlfriends of the boyfriends would want them to have a location sharing app and especially if they have differing phone brands it increases the need for a universal location sharing product. Even families will want location sharing for family safety which means the consumers are not just teenagers or young adults but older people as well.

The growth of the usage of the app seems pretty dang expansive and with our world become more integrated with technology and people's willingness to buy subscriptions, the business seems to be just at the start of growing bigger. Since subscriptions aren't as easily noticeable by the buyer like a physical product, they will be less inclined to¬†consider it a big expense and keep it steady which equals continuous profit. As long as people want a universal app for safety, this company can provide for as long as possible.

I am not sure if they are allowed to sell data, but they could also seel that data for AI purposes down the line since AI is starting to hit a barrier where they are running out of data to train it with.

Additionally, life360 has a social media presence and in my experience, a sns presence equates to a growing company. The feelings of the mass that is displayed in social media such as tiktok or instragram also provides a good idea on if the stock is doing good or bad at the moment.

**Position and NOT FA**

IDK how to post multiple images on here so I will just comment by position. My position isn't that big but it is about 83% of my portfolio because I am broke.

$DIS Disney is at a once in a decade buying opportunity,"This is the weekly chart for $DIS. Each candle represents one week of trading and the chart goes back to 2010.

https://preview.redd.it/1wqkuxf0ldad1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=33e19b58c9f5fa193d355ad551aca96a5061c85c

$DIS has been in a clear uptrend for more than a decade, until the 2022 bear market showed up, inflation and the mini recession wrecked the stock market and $DIS in particular. 

The dark green line is the 80-week moving average. Which represents the average weekly closing price of the last 80 weeks.   
Whenever this moving average is trending up, the equity in question is in an uptrend and vice versa.

Notice how the moving average trended down for nearly two years between 2022 and 2024.

Since the beginning of the year it flattened and has actually been slowly curling up.

Once price breaks above this moving average and comes back to it, it's called a breakout and backtest setup.

This is an incredibly bullish setup with high odds of success. It gives buyers one final chance of entering after the first major breakout.

Now I want you to take a closer look at the volume. Notice how weekly volume has actually been declining as the price has been dropping throughout the last 3 months. This is exactly what you want to see. You want to see sellers less and less interested as the price drops and then you want to see volume expand once buyers are back in and price is trending higher.

ENTRY :  
Now, let's talk about timing the entry. Let's take a look at the zoomed-in portion in pink.  
You will notice that $DIS has a tendency to form a bull flag / bull penant / wedge structure and as soon as price breaks above the resistance level of this structure the stock rallies for several weeks.

Right now we are in the middle of a 3rd one of these structures that hasn't broken out yet. The objective entry would be on the first breakout of this structure if you're looking to trade this aggressively.

Personally. I'm quite happy with the 80-week backtest and I don't want to wait for the breakout so I can buy it here while it's cheap..

TARGET :  
If the stock simply retraces back to the middle of its long-term uptrending channel. That would translate to a rally upwards of $160 by the end of next year.

The December 2025 $120 leap call options are trading at $7.3. That means if the $160 target is realized by the end of 2025, those options will net $40 in profit. a 550% gain in 18 months.  
If the price target is realized earlier, those options will net even higher profit. And if $DIS exceeds this price target, again those gains would be much higher.  
I like the Dec 2025 $120 calls because the far out expiration drastically reduces this risk of theta decay, and gives this setup plenty of time to realize the price target.

Keep in mind that the full-measured move from this consolidation pattern actually puts $DIS at $150 by the end of this year. Which can return an excess of 2000% given how cheap the call options currently are. Just beware of the risk if you're trading this year's Dec expirations.

Good luck regards.

"Same post, four days later.","I firmly believe that Tesla (TSLA) has the potential to reach $250 before August, and here's why:

Historical Performance of QQQ in July: Historically, July has been a strong month for the QQQ. Given this historical trend, I expect the bullish momentum in QQQ to influence Tesla‚Äôs price movement.

Capital Rotation from NVIDIA to Other Stocks: The recent surge in NVIDIA‚Äôs stock has captured significant investor interest. As the stock market operates in cycles, I anticipate a capital rotation where investors move profits from one high-performing stock to others. With NVIDIA‚Äôs impressive rally, it‚Äôs likely that investors will take profits and seek opportunities in other promising tech stocks like Tesla. This influx of capital can drive Tesla‚Äôs stock price higher. 

Combined FOMO from Robotaxi Event, Optimus, and Earnings: Tesla‚Äôs upcoming robotaxi event, the developments around Tesla Optimus, and its earnings report are all highly anticipated. The FOMO on potentially groundbreaking announcements related to Tesla‚Äôs advancements in autonomous driving technology and the Tesla Optimus robot, combined with the anticipation of positive earnings results, can create substantial buying pressure.

I‚Äôll keep you all updated as you tell me I‚Äôm wrong, I‚Äôve only just started trading last month with $500, but I‚Äôve been able to grow it pretty fast with NVIDIA puts and Tesla calls :)

Eli Lilly announced that the drug is suitable for adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and will improve the currently limited treatment options available to U.S. patients suffering from this brain-wasting disease.

""This is real progress,"" said Joanne Pike, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association. ""Tuesday's approval allows people more options and greater opportunity to have more time.""

According to Alzheimer's Association data, nearly 7 million Americans suffer from this disease, which is the fifth leading cause of death among adults over 65 in the United States. By 2050, the number of patients in the U.S. is expected to reach nearly 13 million.

For Eli Lilly, this approval marks a long-anticipated victory, as it signifies the end of a tumultuous approval process for donanemab. In early 2023, the FDA had rejected accelerated approval for the drug based on early trial results, instructing Lilly to submit more trial data. After Lilly provided the additional data, the FDA unexpectedly delayed approval again in March this year.

It wasn't until last month that the drug received the green light from an FDA advisory panel, leading to FDA approval finally being granted on Tuesday.

Anne White, president of Eli Lilly Neuroscience, stated in an interview, ""There's a lot of emotion in the hallways today.""

Following the regulatory approval, donanemab will face direct competition from Leqembi, an Alzheimer's treatment developed by Japan's Eisai and America's Biogen. Leqembi had already received FDA approval last summer and has been gradually rolling out in the U.S.

Within the industry, both donanemab and Leqembi are considered milestone drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Both are monoclonal antibodies targeting toxic substances called amyloid plaques in the brain, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's, to slow disease progression in early-stage patients.

However, donanemab has shown better efficacy compared to Leqembi. According to a late-stage trial, donanemab slowed cognitive decline by 35% compared to the placebo group. After reaching certain targets for amyloid plaque clearance, patients could end treatment and switch to a placebo at 6, 12, or 18 months.",1720031673.0,fda tuesday approved eli lilly drug donanemab marketed brand name kisunla treatment alzheimer disease eli lilly announced drug suitable adults early symptomatic alzheimer disease improve currently limited treatment options available u patients suffering brain wasting disease real progress said joanne pike president ceo alzheimer association tuesday approval allows people options greater opportunity time according alzheimer association data nearly 7 million americans suffer disease fifth leading cause death among adults 65 united states 2050 number patients u expected reach nearly 13 million eli lilly approval marks long anticipated victory signifies end tumultuous approval process donanemab early 2023 fda rejected accelerated approval drug based early trial results instructing lilly submit trial data lilly provided additional data fda unexpectedly delayed approval march year last month drug received green light fda advisory panel leading fda approval finally granted tuesday anne white president eli lilly neuroscience stated interview lot emotion hallways today following regulatory approval donanemab face direct competition leqembi alzheimer treatment developed japan eisai america biogen leqembi already received fda approval last summer gradually rolling u within industry donanemab leqembi considered milestone drugs treatment alzheimer disease monoclonal antibodies targeting toxic substances called amyloid plaques brain hallmark alzheimer slow disease progression early stage patients however donanemab shown better efficacy compared leqembi according late stage trial donanemab slowed cognitive decline 35 compared placebo group reaching certain targets amyloid plaque clearance patients could end treatment switch placebo 6 12 18 months,0.9805,2024-07-03

Beyond on the rise,"I'm new here and my goal is for all of us to be rich. I want your opinion about Beyond Meat stock symbol BYND. This is a great company with lots of potential. Hedge funds and rich stock market investors have overlooked the value of this company just like they overlook the people that buy this product. They have overblown the digital risks for BYND and they have negative sentiment about the company that can be seen by the huge short interest. The value of BYND is overlooked. Every time I go to the store this product is selling great and they introduce new variations of the product. I get it...many people like real meat; however, the market for plant based food like BYND has increased to almost a 28 billion dollar a year industry. Wall Street is betting that BYND is going to fail but vegans like me are not going away even though we get laughed at and are often the punch line to jokes. You may even be laughing as you read this post. If BYND fails and goes bankrupt the people that work there will loose their job and the millionaire/billionaire hedge fund people that bet against this company will make a huge profit. We the people can take back the power and help this company be successful by investing in BYND. I know the overall share price wave has decreased since they went public in 2019; however, I personally believe this company is an underdog company that will have a great comeback story that will go in the Wall Street history books with an upward trending wave. If you do research you will see the cattle farming industry is running out of land to farm and raise animals and they have to pump the animals with antibiotics and steroids so they can grow faster and not have disease to keep up with the consumer demand. If the world or our country has a major disaster it would definitely impact the cattle farming and food industry and many would have to turn to eating plant based foods like BYND even if we didn't want to. It's better to get the upper hand now and invest in BYND and take advantage of the blessings that will ultimately come. I no way is this post endorsing BYND and I'm not telling you to go buy the stock.

ZIM: Let's go again!,"I believe ZIM will soar to at least $40 (x2), maybe more, in the next 4-6 weeks. Here‚Äôs why:

**Market Situation**

1. **Container Shipping Rates:**¬†They‚Äôve skyrocketed and show no signs of stopping.
2. **Red Sea Drama:**¬†With the Red Sea routes disrupted, ships are taking the scenic route around Africa. This requires 10-12% more ships, absorbing last year‚Äôs new builds and most of the upcoming new fleet.
3. **Container Chaos:**¬†More ships mean more disorganized containers. Shippers hate waiting for empty containers, leaving them at destination ports.
4. **Tariff Tango:**¬†Biden‚Äôs tariff increases have importers scrambling to ship earlier than the usual August-October peak. Inventories are low after years of adjustments.
5. **Trump‚Äôs Tariff Tease:**¬†With Trump promising additional tariffs, companies are likely to import more now to avoid future costs. It‚Äôs like a retail apocalypse, but for shipping!

Rates logically going up

**Zim Shipping**

1. **Big Player:**¬†ZIM is the 10th largest shipping company, mostly leasing boats but owning a few.
2. **Volatile Market:**¬†Shipping is ultra-competitive. When companies make money, they all buy boats, leading to oversupply, like in 2023.
3. **Red Sea Plans:**¬†Like others, ZIM expects Red Sea issues to ease and rates to drop with a large supply of new vessels by year-end.
4. **Management‚Äôs Gloomy Outlook:**¬†Despite being insiders, ZIM‚Äôs management didn‚Äôt foresee the recent rate spikes and forecasted a tough year-end during earnings calls.
5. **Genius Move:**¬†ZIM didn‚Äôt contract volume for their fleet this year, a rarity. Normally, 70% is contracted to limit volatility, but this year, 65% operates on spot rates, which are currently exploding. They avoided low rates proposed by customers expecting a drop. I don't know if this was thought through but I only care about the result, a genuis move!

**Reasons to Believe**

1. **FOMO & Tariff Talk:**¬†Supply chain directors are ordering because they are seeing chaos coming and don't want to loss their job. For COVID-19, they had a good excuse, but this time, they will be asked to explain why they bragged last year and have nothing to sale this year. Panic buying is imminent if rates hit $8K in August. Funny, right? Not so much for them.
2. **Shanghai-LA Route:**¬†ZIM has 30% of their fleet here. Spot rates are at $6,6K, up from Q1‚Äôs $1.9K.
3. **Printing Money:**¬†ZIM made a killing in 2021 and 2022 when shipping was underestimated. Wall Street will catch on.
4. **Q2 Earnings:**¬†ZIM will likely post $600-800M in Q2. Estimates are lower due to delivery payment arguments, but surcharges could boost earnings. Q3 could see $1.2-1.5B if rates stabilize and I am not talking if they goes to 10k.
5. **Undervalued:**¬†We're talking about $2B in two quarters for a company valued at $2.6B. With 11% short interest, the market‚Äôs in for a surprise.

**Counter Arguments**

1. **Red Sea Resolved:**¬†Sure, Middle Eastern politics will magically stabilize in 2-3 months (sarcasm intended). And the whole situation has nothing to do with Russian/Iran and co. Everybody wants the peace especially the houtis
2. **Rates Drop:**¬†Absolutely, Americans will suddenly stop buying because they are planning to save money when the stock market is at all time high. And shipping remains the world's cheapest option to import cheap China goods even at $10K per container. And China needs to export.
3. **Huge Debt:**¬†ZIM‚Äôs $5.3B debt includes lease obligations for the next 5-8 years. It‚Äôs like counting Microsoft‚Äôs electricity bills for the next 8 years as debt. The reality is Zim will likely redistribute around $10-12 of the profit this year.
4. **No change in the Summer:**¬†Possible, but shipping‚Äôs peak season starts in August, anticipating post-summer and Black Friday demand. Usually big moves are in the summer for shipping. If you have 6 hours of your life to kill, watch this:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KovvaLWBSs4&t=2007s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KovvaLWBSs4&t=2007s)¬†. Ok, I will be nice with you, 5:21:00.

**Conclusion**

Cathy Wood cut some of her Tesla ( TSLA ) stock and increased her stake in emerging drone maker Archer Aviation ( ACHR ) Is ACHR Worth Watch,"Wood and Ark Invest sold a total of 62,867 shares of Tesla stock on Tuesday, valued at $14.538 million at the closing price of 231.26. Meanwhile, Wood and ARK purchased 406,912 shares of Archer Aviation stock on Tuesday, valued at $1.51 million based on a closing price of 3.72. San Jose-based Archer is developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for urban environments, with the goal of creating a robust air cab service. Archer Aviation received an additional $55 million investment from Stellantis (STLA) on Tuesday through a strategic financing agreement. Stellantis invested $110 million in Archer in 2023 through a series of open market stock purchases and strategic agreement investments. The investment follows Archer's June 8 completion of a critical test flight of its Midnight aircraft.



On June 5, the company announced that it had received FAA certification to begin operating as a commercial airline, and on June 17, Archer entered into an agreement with Signature Aviation to provide it with access to the world's largest network of private airline terminals. Under the agreement, Archer plans to launch air cab services as early as the end of 2025 at United Airlines (UAL) hubs at Newark International Airport and Chicago O'Hare Airport. The agreement also gives Archer access to takeoff and landing locations in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Texas.



Signature Aviation operates more than 200 private terminals worldwide. According to the company, Archer plans to expand throughout its network as aircraft availability increases.



On June 20, Archer unveiled additional plans to establish an air mobility network at five locations in the San Francisco Bay Area.",1720018340.0,wood ark invest sold total 62 867 shares tesla stock tuesday valued 14 538 million closing price 231 26 meanwhile wood ark purchased 406 912 shares archer aviation stock tuesday valued 1 51 million based closing price 3 72 san jose based archer developing electric vertical takeoff landing evtol aircraft urban environments goal creating robust air cab service archer aviation received additional 55 million investment stellantis stla tuesday strategic financing agreement stellantis invested 110 million archer 2023 series open market stock purchases strategic agreement investments investment follows archer june 8 completion critical test flight midnight aircraft june 5 company announced received faa certification begin operating commercial airline june 17 archer entered agreement signature aviation provide access world largest network private airline terminals agreement archer plans launch air cab services early end 2025 united airlines ual hubs newark international airport chicago hare airport agreement also gives archer access takeoff landing locations new york los angeles san francisco texas signature aviation operates 200 private terminals worldwide according company archer plans expand throughout network aircraft availability increases june 20 archer unveiled additional plans establish air mobility network five locations san francisco bay area,0.9847,2024-07-03

Another Bear bites the dust. JPM‚Äôs kolanovic ‚ÄúGandalf‚Äù fired for being too bearish,"Marco Kolanovic has been bearish for two years, horrible calls finally catch up with him.. He had lost all credibility after ZeroHedge annointed him as a market ‚ÄúGandalf‚Äù

Is this the contrarian indicator we are waiting for.

PMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) chief global markets strategist Marko Kolanovic is planning to leave the bank, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing an internal memo it obtained.

Kolanovic is perhaps infamously known for his conflicting stock-market calls over the past two years which have differed significantly from Wall Street's actual performance.

Kolanovic, who according to his LinkedIn profile has been at JPMorgan (JPM) for over 16 years, is ""exploring other opportunities,"" as per the memo as quoted by Bloomberg.

Kolanovic also served as co-head of JPMorgan's (JPM) global research. The memo said Hussein Malik will now become the sole head.

JPMorgan (JPM) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha, and neither did Kolanovic nor Malik.

Kolanovic was consistently bullish on U.S. equities for much of 2022, a year in which the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) slumped nearly 20%.

The analyst turned bearish towards the end of the market bottoming out, and has remained firmly so even as the S&P (SP500) rebounded almost 25% in 2023 and advanced more than 14% in H1 2024.

As recently as Friday, Kolanovic backed his ultra-bearish year-end target of 4,200 points for the S&P 500 (SP500), even as the index has powered past 5,500 and has caused other brokerages to drive up their estimates.",1720012846.0,marco kolanovic bearish two years horrible calls finally catch lost credibility zerohedge annointed market gandalf contrarian indicator waiting pmorgan chase nyse jpm chief global markets strategist marko kolanovic planning leave bank bloomberg news reported wednesday citing internal memo obtained kolanovic perhaps infamously known conflicting stock market calls past two years differed significantly wall street actual performance kolanovic according linkedin profile jpmorgan jpm 16 years exploring opportunities per memo quoted bloomberg kolanovic also served co head jpmorgan jpm global research memo said hussein malik become sole head jpmorgan jpm immediately respond request comment seeking alpha neither kolanovic malik kolanovic consistently bullish u equities much 2022 year benchmark p 500 sp500 slumped nearly 20 analyst turned bearish towards end market bottoming remained firmly even p sp500 rebounded almost 25 2023 advanced 14 h1 2024 recently friday kolanovic backed ultra bearish year end target 4 200 points p 500 sp500 even index powered past 5 500 caused brokerages drive estimates,-0.6444,2024-07-03

Geopolitical pressure on shipping rates,"Red Sea shipping is still an issue and only getting worse/more expensive . Now shipping will be done by air.

*Increased demand is a factor in the air freight market. In a recent note to clients, Xeneta wrote that the global air cargo market is ""on a pathway to double-digit growth in volumes in 2024, after a +12% year-on-year jump in demand in May.*

Inflationary pressure continues. Insurance rates will continue to climb. As shipping costs continue to go up...

Prices will be keep getting passed to cash strapped consumers or companies will lose money as money as their pricing powers are gone, and have to eat the extra costs.

I don't actually know what this means, but 2.3 million sounds like a big number. And big number of options mean big volumes of trade. And big number of trade means the stock will either move up or down bigly.

Porsche holding extremly undervalued?,"Most of us probably know that Porsche is somehow involved in owning itself through Volkswagen. For those who don‚Äôt know (I don‚Äôt really understand it either), there are two kinds of Porsche stocks.

The first one is the manufacturing company, Porsche AG, with the ticker symbol $P911, which is primarily owned by Volkswagen.

Then there is another Porsche stock, $PAH3, which is a holding company that owns the majority of Volkswagen stock.

Porsche Holding is extremely undervalued with a P/E ratio of 2.53, which is even lower than the P/E ratio of Volkswagen and much lower than the P/E of $P911.

Can someone explain to me why Porsche Holding is so cheap? When buying this stock, it essentially means buying the Porsche manufacturing company at a 30-40% discount, plus you also get the other stocks that Volkswagen owns.

They have the charging infrastructure, the manufacturing capacity to build robotaxis/humanoid robots, energy storage,  software development, the data, and even lithium production.

Visa moon theory in light of recent SC rulings,"So, two related SC rulings that play into this

1) corner post

2) chevron 

There‚Äôs plenty of room for nuance and I‚Äôve got to look into it much, much more, but, here‚Äôs my general take aways

1) swipe fee companies can create as many bullshit companies as they want to challenge regulations in perpetuity 

2) swipe fee companies can jack rates indiscriminately with no regard for regulations outside the letter of the law.

While the chevron ruling includes a caveat that it‚Äôs not retroactively ‚Äúundoing‚Äù everything established, they make it clear that those precedents are not set in stone either. They literally are not law. Therefore, between the two cases, swipe fee companies should be able to generate companies to challenge regulations at will, forever, and the regulations they challenge, outside that which is outlined in the underlying law, essentially have no authority. Obviously, the SC is gonna do what it wants regardless of hypocrisy and/or technicality, but if there isn‚Äôt a hard on for swipe fee companies I think in time this could mean the cuffs just got reallll loose

NVDA H20 Demand Stronger Than Expected - Morgan Stanley,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-h20-demand-stronger-than-expected-morgan-stanley-3505205

Main point of the article:

_Per Morgan Stanley‚Äôs note, major hyperscalers in China, while complying with export control regulations, are purchasing NVIDIA‚Äôs H20 chips for AI computing needs. Although smaller AI data center vendors in China can offer the H100 GPU for rental, the larger hyperscalers are opting to buy the H20, adhering to the regulatory requirements.
Based on their field trip takeaways, analysts said the single-chip performance of the H20 is only 15% that of the H100. Furthermore, when comparing ""Performance Density"" based on the Float 16 data type, the H20's single chip performance is only 3% of that of the H100.
‚ÄúHowever, by connecting a cluster of H20 GPUs, performance can reach 50% of that of the H100, thanks to higher networking bandwidth and the HBM density of H20,‚Äù analysts pointed out. ‚ÄúAnd hence it is possible the H20 chip price could also be 50% of H100.‚Äù_

Jensen keeps telling y‚Äôall the world isn‚Äôt waiting on shit ‚Äî the AI race is on now, and there‚Äôs no stopping it in the near future. Does that guarantee NVDA will dominate like this for the next decade? I don‚Äôt fucking know, I work at Wendy‚Äôs.

But when even your biggest political foe cannot keep its hands off nvda chips, may be some of you chubby berrs should give it a rest too.

"Is Palantir just a ""glorified"" consulting company?","Like a lot of you, I was bullish on Palantir (PLTR) for a long time. But after spending more time looking into it, I'm starting to feel less optimistic. Here's what feels off to me:

* I've spent a lot of time with data science and AI, but I rarely see Palantir products in the wild. Snowflake's products, for comparison, are pretty ubiquitous for data engineering.
* The AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) looks great on paper, but it'll take a lot of resources to implement it. Just picture trying to integrate all the production and logistics details of even a small-sized company‚Äîit‚Äôs a huge task that requires a lot of Palantir experts and thus money.
* This brings me to the next thing: Palantir was often called a ""glorified"" IT consulting company, not a real software company. From what I know, Palantir doesn't have its own foundational AI model. AIP is ""just"" a platform for implementing models like GPT-4 and mirroring a company's internal networks. Such customized software solutions must be a huge effort to create and maintain. But what's the moat here? That doesn't mean that the resulting software is bad, but how does this scale? To me, this sounds like a consulting business...
* Palantir has a great reputation thanks to its government contracts. But this mainly comes from the days when it was hard for government organizations to find good programmers - perfect conditions for an IT consulting company. 
* Palantir's bulls often say that the company's most advanced technology is top secret, which makes it hard to see how they're ahead of the game. If these cutting-edge technologies are only for the military and intelligence, then Palantir is basically a defense contractor, which also doesn‚Äôt justify the current valuation.

The story of how Nvidias volatility fd me in the a**,"https://preview.redd.it/oov30kqov0ad1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f195a9c03c24bbcd364f40680d992e453dd24ad

Let this be a lesson to every regard that strikes it rich. Never Fomo in again and get angry when making investment decisions, because you will get your bootywhole pummeled without lube and it will be brutal

I think what makes this post 10x more brutal is that I'm 28 so this is basically my life savings lol

I was planning on taking a chick out to vacay and buying a property but I guess I'll do that in the next 3 years or so lol

THE STORY

The reason why I didn't buy calls again after the stellar earnings report is because after having traded Nvidia for several months, I knew what kind of monster I was dealing with. High sensitivity to federal reserve rate announcements, the war in Gaza, tech shows etc. even when I put a stop loss I'd wake up and see it sell and blow past the stop loss I put it at so if I sell early I lose if I don't sell I lose it was all fucked lol

So I was like ok let's avoid the stress of waking up and seeing me getting fucked because of a bad position or for it to drop back down to the low thousands I'll just stay out for a bit

Little did I know, this fucking company would go up 40% over the span of 2 months with only a 20% increase in guidance. How does that even remotely make sense

But it's clear that stock markets have long abandoned rational movement patterns. It should have stopped around 1150 or 1200 and corrected down to 1100 or something but nah that Bch kept going up

And it just pissed me off so much, I could've full ported again and had half a million in the bank and never had to deal with this shit again, but I opted out and opted back in at the worst possible time and in the worst way possible lmao

Knowing my luck this shits gonna trade sideways for the rest of July and then start the ascent on August so I'll buy august calls when they're a little cheaper and do another full port on this earnings. After that I'll probably ride the gains for a week and never touch this shit again lol

Either that or lose every penny ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

Resist the urge to short healthcare stocks as they print new ATHs this year,"People will hate buy puts on LLY/NVO/HIMS and other pharma shit bc of the ‚Äúit‚Äôs up so much already, it‚Äôs due for a pullback or reduced earnings from new competition, tech level valuations for pharma companies isn‚Äôt reasonable‚Äù trap. 

Especially as LLY becomes the first trillion dollar healthcare company owing to their GLP1 and other longevity breakthroughs (and kicks off market wide fomo). 

They‚Äôll ‚Äúaverage‚Äù into puts and wake up to new ATHs. It‚Äôll drive them insane. If you don‚Äôt believe me, ask the guy here who‚Äôs been shorting LLY since 400$ and seetheposting begging people to buy puts every other week. 

I think what bers get wrong is that healthcare isn‚Äôt like electronics or utilities or other goods (where you anticipate spending/costs/margins/earnings growth hitting a wall from all the advancements). 

On the contrary, as we inch towards a world that‚Äôs more and more automated (despite what all the doomers calling for the end of the world want to believe), healthcare is the only sector that will justify and see more spending imo. 

If spared from the usual mundane burdens of life (owing to increased efficiency across the economy), Wouldn‚Äôt you spend more of your income and time on healthcare? Whether surface level stuff like fixing baldness (to signal status in a world where those games are inescapable) or serious stuff like addiction or obesity which leads to overall well being? 

I personally (even if a bit naive) am hopeful for an optimistic future where all of us spend a larger % of our income ‚Äîon everything from glp1, reversible gene therapy, early prevention solutions unique to your DNA profile‚Äî in an attempt to extend our lifetime, if only because everything else in life has become much more cheaper/accessible.

$RL Ralph Lauren EZ Dip Buy Off Disastrous NKE Earnings,"Hello Degens, I understand most of you buy your clothes from Supreme, Walmart, and Goodwill but I come to you with a fashion DD for a brand with strong momentum in an increasingly fraught segment of consumer discretionary luxury fashion. The stock market regularly fucks up on consumer trends that are staring them in the face because fund managers are old ass white dudes who could care less about what Zoomers are wearing. This market inefficiency is easily exploited if you just walk around college campuses and big cities and pay attention. This is why I've made racks off Abercrombie & Fitch and Crocs while Wall Street and you basement dwellers could only scratch your heads as to why Tik Tok Americans are buying this crap.

I come to you with this next fashion trade: a quintessential American brand focused on old WASPy aesthetics and aspirational wealth made available to the average consumer. For a long time, RL was languishing as the only people buying their gaudy sportwear were software engineers and sysadmins who wear too much cologne. Finally, this brand has leaned into its classic and refined designs and is appealing to a new base of consumers who are conscious of fashion brands ripping them off with poor quality design and materials. Zoomers grow tired of their Shein hauls lasting 4-5 wears before falling apart and are now seeking quality. For this they turn to RL.

# Why üåàüêª Are Wrong

Following Nike's disastrous earnings RL has continued a downward trend from ATH finding support at \~$170. Many assume that RL trades in the same group as companies like NKE and LULU, these are all luxury fashion brands of course, but RL is positioned differently. Athleisure is dead. If you walk around big cities like New York, regardless of time of day, fewer women are wearing the full LULU yoga set. The market for athleisure is saturated and being disrupted by cheap brands like Alo and Shein. Another trend fund managers fail to understand is Return to Office Fashion. You have an entire generation of young women who have never had a real job - and if they did it was a remote internship during the scamdemic - now asking on Tik Tok: ""How do I dress for the office""? [Ralph is a favorite brand](https://www.tiktok.com/@sx.ash/video/7324422099257347360?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7340732515428959790) for these [office girlies](https://www.tiktok.com/@mrsinkeduk/video/7314567769750523168?q=Ralph%20Lauren%20office&t=1719855177692) still figuring out what they're to be wearing. NKE and LULU make fund managers think that the American consumer is faltering, but this is not the case. They are simply terrible at managing trends. Look at Nike's product offerings. The [Adidas Samba](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Fus%2Fsamba-og-shoes%2FB75806.html&psig=AOvVaw0q5eapOvTD7lqAqoakYuB-&ust=1719941639846000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCOD42YSwhocDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) is the hottest sneaker right now for young men and women, coming off of the dominance of New Balance's suede casual sneakers. Nike makes only 1 or 2 sneakers ([Killshot](https://www.nike.com/t/killshot-2-womens-shoes-3z3Nnb/FZ5630-100) and Cortez) that have this classic casual, white leather look that consumers are looking for. Instead they focus only on athleisure and workout segments rather than fashion.

In fashion, all of these mid level mall brands are trying to reposition themselves as ""luxury"" for the simple reason that they can charge more for each garment. However, many are doing this wrong. They are selling the same plastic crap for higher prices with more marketing. This has not been working great for Zara, Uniqlo, H&M, and others. This has worked out very well for Abercrombie & Fitch, Wall Street's current fashion darling, A&F has pivoted to selling clothes that are on trend with minimal branding and a commitment to quality. [A $50 shirt from A&F](https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/long-sleeve-rugby-polo-53491348?seq=01&source=googleshopping&cmp=PLA:EVG:20:A:D:US:X:GGL:X:SHOP:X:X:X:X:x:A%26F+Adults_Google_Shopping_PLA_US_Tops_All+products_PRODUCT_GROUP&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwp4m0BhBAEiwAsdc4aKoAbCRC5Ox_imUloA2HQ9JoIj4d8l92rJcS5INAYK3sD6vmshmrZxoCpo0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) uses high quality cotton that you can feel will last while Uniqlo keeps trying to market its $50 polyester shirts as ""office tech wear"" or some crap. RL is uniquely positioned with its brand placement historically to offer high quality items for high prices, and the consumer knows these garments will last for years. In addition, these looks are ""classic Americana"" and won't go out of style as quickly as these [Shein microtrends](https://www.tiktok.com/@catyaps/video/7353318659533622570?q=microtrends&t=1719855637194). The consumer has more confidence buying an RL garment that they are getting their money's worth for a quality garment.

I mentioned that walking around New York City you do not see athleisure, but you do see RL's biggest sellers everywhere. Gay guys love the Polo Bear: wearing it on sweaters and tshirts. Women love the American Flag sweater as an ""Old Money Fashion"" statement piece. I frequently see dupes from[ Shein or other Chinese crap](https://us.shein.com/American-Flag-Pattern-Drop-Shoulder-Sweater-p-21875906-cat-1734.html) companies of the American Flag sweater. This is probably bearish, but imitation is the highest form of flattery I guess? The trend is growing and has staying power if other companies want to swoop in.

Off the backs of these trendy items, RL has recently launched its Olympics Team USA collection which incorporates many designs from the brand's classic Americana past. This is already generating [social media buzz](https://x.com/fetacheesepls/status/1807467583035089004), and as we approach the Olympics this will create brand momentum. The opening ceremony and the team's clothing will likely generate additional buzz. We are 25 days out from the Olympics, this should be a great window to build a short term trade with the stock currently at support.

# Fundamentals

For a quick look at fundamentals, let's do a Peer comparison:

|Ticker|PE|TEV/EBIDTA|Debt/EBITDA|Gross Margin PCT|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LULU|24.0|11.9|0.5|58.3%|
|NKE|20.2|14.0|1.5|44.6%|
|LEVI|53.6|8.2|2.0|58.0%|
|ANF|22.2|8.1|0.9|64.1%|
|**RL**|**18.0**|**7.2**|**1.6**|**66.8%**|

As we can see, RL is a leader among its peers in margin while trading at a discount relative to some of the biggest players in the space. RL carries some higher debt levels, but for a brand with this kind of momentum it is good to see them investing in current trends. This will pay off long term. If RL were trading at the median PE of its peer group the stock would see a 27% gain. If it were trading at median Price/Revenue we would see a 22% gain. My long term price target for RL is thus a 25% gain putting us at about $212/share.

A quick look at the balance sheet. EPS is up 28% YoY with Revenue mostly flat at 2.9% increase YoY. Interestingly, the street estimates that 2025 Revenue will only increase 2.35%. I believe analysts are missing the trend and growing momentum behind RL. Increased sales volume will lead a surge in revenue growth, and assuming margin improvements persist you will see a much greater increase in EPS.

# Technicals

https://preview.redd.it/u2olfdnx3y9d1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f3ed3329f935ac14abfa193a34433eae15d15fb

For a quick look at technicals, RL's monster earnings in February broke them out of a long term channel and price has been volatile since. The earnings pump sold off only to pump on their earnings again in late May. The stock is finding support at a long term Fibonacci level around $170. Momentum looks shit right now, it is on the lower end of the bollinger bands and looking oversold on the stochastic. I'm looking to buy around the $170 Fibonacci and psychological support and will continue to buy down to $160.

JACK In The Box - bankrupt?,"JACK is the lowest its been in 10 years (with the exception of the covid crash in 2020)

It‚Äôs been on a relentless downward streak for 6 months straight, with almost no rebounds. 

Contrast this with McDonalds, which has been on a relentless upward streak for the past 10 years (with the exception of the past 6 months, which also has been trending down).

Why SPX Could Hit 6000 by Year-En,"There's an interesting seasonal pattern with the SPX. In the second half of the year, the index tends to rise more frequently and significantly than in the first half.

Moreover, if there was a notable increase in the first half, like the 14.48% this year, growth in the second half is almost inevitable.

If we plot the second half's performance on the trend line‚Äîthat is, the line that minimizes the distance from all points on the chart‚Äîwe can expect an additional +10%, with a very narrow range of possible values.

The low dispersion intrigued me the most. It almost rules out the possibility of ending the year below 5600, and more likely points to a level closer to 6000

HIMS GLP user forecast ,"Taking a look at current subscriber base of HIMS -  which is about 1.6MM 

For a hypo - let‚Äôs say 10% of their sub base decides to go on GLP‚Äôs 

So we have 160k using GLP‚Äôs via HIMS at 1.99 a month. 

1.99 X 12 X 160000 = 380MM 

This does not factor in new subscribers coming into HIMS and signing up for GLP‚Äôs
( who knows what that number might be ) 

This also does not factor in new subscribers choosing other products like dick pills or hair loss and seeing HIMS as a one stop shop for bone dogs, losing some weight and getting some hair - 

Currently HIMS forecasted to do about 1.2BB for 2024 and be in the black a couple hundred million 

If they come out and say the growth rate is even at this level how does this stock not go parabolic ? Do we really think at that point HIMS continues to trade at 3x sales give or take ?

There are over 100MM people who are obese in the USA ( that‚Äôs probably on the light side ) 

So we are basically asking for less than .2% of 1% of obese people in the USA to sign up for a product that is 80% cheaper than WEGOVY  ? 

I believe we are going to see some seriously explosive numbers that take this stock parabolic.  This name is mispriced for maybe the CEO and his comments , that short report, people saying there is no Moat and all that.

Nvidia: Not a Darling Anymore,"Nvidia after briefly reaching #1 spot by market cap has fallen.

Last week was full of news of Hedge funds and institutional buyers triming their portfolio fearing the stock has risen too rapidly.

Even the annual share holder meeting on 26th June failed to restore the moment and the stock continued to languish at sub 130$ levels.

Some have put blame on Q3 [supposedly a quarter for poor returns for tech stock] while others have pointed out to investor fatigue with the stock.

This morning [1st July], Nvda is down 2% in pre-market and threatening to drop below pre-split levels.

Technical traders have pointed to a gap at 95-99$ that is yet to be filled. 

What to do? 

While Nvidia remains a dominant player in the AI/GPU segment, current softness in the stock and Nasdaq in general allows for some bearish play:

1) Buy Bear Put Spread: 
     Buy 121$ Put
     Sell 120$ Put
With 12th July expiry

2) Sell Bear Call Spread
     Sell 125$ Call
     Buy 126$ Call
With 5th July expiry

"NVDA will pop by the of August, I am a newb, and here are my thoughts. (Earning, Tesla Taxi)","So, so far, after earnings, NVDA either stayed the same or went up. It could.. happen again, right? Especially if they beat their earnings again, etc.

Also, in August, Musk said he will launch Tesla Taxi on August 8, and the autonomous hardware uses NVDA. Jensen said that Tesla is very advanced in self driving. Musk did it once, he could do it again. Not saying his first taxi will be good, his first Tesla wasnt good either. But he managed to scale it. And the same with SpaceX. Regardless it will be a pump on [X.com](http://X.com) I think it might go up to 140-160.

PS: this is not a joke - NVDA was recommended to me in 2018 by a real autistic man, wearing a long scarf, who went around the coffee shop telling people nearby to 'buy NVDA to ensure your retirement' he also said not to invest your life savings into it though; he bought in at 70 pre pre split.

DRAFTKINGS,"Draftkings is arguably approaching it‚Äôs most popular season of the year, Fantasy Football. With price targets averaged at $53.86 with a ‚ÄúStrong Buy‚Äù rating, currently, DKNG is UNDERVALUED BY 44%. On top of this, the RSI is sitting at 41, almost OVERSOLD, and the MacD is at -0.15. This typically shows downward momentum, but these also often indicate a strong reversal in stock direction is approaching. 

Draftkings also has great financials, reporting a 57% YOY revenue increase, according to the quarter ending March 31, with projected 31-36% YOY  growth in revenue for fiscal year 2024. 

Despite this, the short interest in DraftKings (DKNG) has risen by 26.69% since its last report, with 21.32 million shares sold short, which is 4.51% of all regular shares available for trading. And I know short interest is a shot in the dark, but it definitely means something in situations like this where a strong stock is already 50% undervalued and hasn‚Äôt even hit it‚Äôs most popular season yet. 

With all of this considered, I believe DKNG is a STRONG investment, and specifically September (when NFL season begins) calls may be an absolute banger for most.

Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by year‚Äôs end,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they‚Äôve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don‚Äôt settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidia‚Äôs stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn‚Äôt just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn‚Äôt possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia‚Äôs place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn‚Äôt happened and Nvidia‚Äôs only gotten stronger.

That‚Äôs not to say over time Nvidia won‚Äôt lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it‚Äôs not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don‚Äôt think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia‚Äôs growth story.",1719798810.0,lot people think nvidia overvalued bubble think nvidia easily get 150 end july beginning august 200 end year ai nvidia along generational investment opportunities nvidia first mover advantage continuously blown expectations water earnings reports settle constantly innovate new chips blackwell coming even efficient economical yes nvidia stock valuation 3t high one point 1t unthinkable apple crossed line stop iphones expanded services nvidia self driving cars human robots weather forecasting safety whether manufacturing complex companies industries medical diagnosis cures diseases huge boom stock going forward possibilities ai exponential whether like trillion dollar companies seem becoming norm broadcom could next exclusive club every time investors saying nvidia possibly go anymore beat earnings nvidia shatters expectations stock goes many times articles saying amd would take nvidia place nvidia killing chip yet years happened nvidia gotten stronger say time nvidia lose market share year miss earnings report always going 100 rosy smooth sailing chip stock fundamentally risks economic downturn human caused climate change regulations demand power grid threaten ai time believe end day ai play large role future nvidia center chips many things potential ai change world really could start next industrial revolution plus given bloated valuations every stock right much alphabet amazon microsoft apple increasing valuations nvidia far alone high valuations think ai bubble think nvidia market whole get ahead overall likely initial first stage end nvidia growth story,0.9349,2024-07-01

Bearish about AAPL,"Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the number of companies citing ‚ÄúAI‚Äù in their earnings calls has exploded, with 199 S&P 500 companies mentioning it at least once in their Q1 2024 calls. However, management optimism still hasn‚Äôt translated to company profits.

Despite mentioning ‚ÄúAI‚Äù 40 times in its Q1 2024 earnings call, Adobe‚Äôs management predicted decelerating earnings and revenue growth of 12% and 10%, respectively, and its stock fell by 13.7% that day.

Similarly, Salesforce and Dell, which had both tripled between December 2022 and May 2024 on AI optimism, fell 18% and 15%, respectively, after their May earnings calls, with Morgan Stanley analysts noting that GenAI bookings still hadn‚Äôt improved Salesforce‚Äôs top line, while Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi asked if Dell was selling its AI servers at zero margin, noting that its $1.7 billion in server revenue didn‚Äôt boost operating profits.

While many companies are surely to profit from AI boom such as NVIDIA from chip sales and Microsoft from cloud compute, will Apple be one of them?

Much of Apples stock boom has been around its AI hype. However, it‚Äôs still yet to see how this translates into more iPhone sales or higher profitability for the company? Are they planning to offer AI as an add-on like Samsung? There‚Äôs also the question of public‚Äôs perception of privacy concerns. 

Thoughts?

what are your projections for TSLA 8/24/24?,"The concept of robotaxis, particularly spearheaded by a company like Tesla, holds promising prospects:

Accessibility: Robotaxis could provide a reliable transportation option for those who cannot afford a personal vehicle. This can significantly enhance mobility for people in lower-income brackets, the elderly, and those with disabilities.

Cost Efficiency: Autonomous vehicles can operate around the clock without the need for a human driver, reducing operational costs. This could result in more affordable ride-hailing services, making transportation more economical for everyone.

Traffic and Emissions Reduction: Autonomous vehicles can optimize routes and improve traffic flow, potentially reducing congestion. With a fleet of electric robotaxis, the overall emissions could decrease, contributing to cleaner air in urban areas.

Safety Improvements: AI-driven vehicles have the potential to reduce accidents caused by error. Enhanced safety features and constant monitoring can make roads safer for all users.

Urban Planning and Infrastructure: Widespread adoption of robotaxis could influence urban planning. Cities might repurpose parking spaces for green areas, pedestrian zones, or other community uses, as the need for personal vehicle ownership decreases.

Economic Impact: The development and deployment of robotaxis can create new job opportunities in tech, maintenance, and infrastructure development, while also potentially displacing traditional driving jobs. This shift will require new training and adaptation in the workforce.

Environmental Benefits: As Tesla's fleet is electric, robotaxis will likely reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.

Socioeconomic Impact: By providing affordable and efficient transportation, robotaxis can help bridge the mobility gap, enabling people from various socioeconomic backgrounds to access better job opportunities, education, and healthcare.

Tesla's leadership in AI and autonomous driving technology positions it well to drive this change. The company's existing infrastructure, extensive research, and development in AI and energy storage solutions provide a strong foundation for the successful implementation of robotaxis.

ASTS,"AST D2D 5G technology is ready to enhance the telecommunications industry. This will commence at the end of Sept when they launch 5 sats - BB1s. 5 sats which will provide 125 milly revs next year and already have AST EBIDTA break even purportedly. The plan is to produce 4 sats per month next year and beyond. Approx 100 sats are needed to be fully operational. 

AST has superior tech to any pretenders trying to get into the space and they will have no competitor for years. Their tech is patented and took them many years to establish. Starlink tend to be who people fear the most re competition. There is a misconception that Starlink are ahead of the game with anything to do with space based communication services. Starlink are largely in a diff lane - broadband and have yet to show that they will be a real competitor at all in the D2D 5G space. Even in their main area of focus, broadband, their tech is expensive and clunky - requiring a receiver for functionality. They‚Äôve literally just announced in the last year or two that they‚Äôre going to get involved in the D2D space. How many years behind AST are they? Maybe 5? Maybe more?‚Ä¶

AST have MOU‚Äôs with over 50 MNO‚Äôs including Vodafone and Rakuten. They have recently signed commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon, as well as received strategic funding from both companies. This is what led to a recent share price surge as the sole remaining short thesis - funding risks/dilution - was invalidated. Furthermore, AST are set to dominate the US market with AT&T and Verizon on board. Imo it seems likely T-Mobile, who have a relationship with Starlink, will have to follow suit because Starlink have no service to offer them and won‚Äôt for many years, if ever. The scant short thesis has now evaporated and they have started to cover - as seen by a 30% or so reduction in short interest over the last month. AST have said there will be no more dilution this year. It seems there will be no more public offerings full stop going forward as AST have 50 MNO‚Äôs yet to formalise commercial agreements with - many of whom will provide strategic investment/funding via revenue prepayment and convertible loans. 

AT&T recently said that they surveyed their subscribers and 30-40% said they would sign up to AST‚Äôs service when available. AST have access to 2.8 billion users through existing agreements with MNO‚Äôs. If we assume even a pessimistic take up of 20% (not the 30-40% AT&T mentioned) then that would be 560 million yearly users of ASTS. This is not including users who are currently in dead zones of many parts of Asia, Africa, South America who currently have no phones (as there are no telecom poles/companies providing signal - a problem which AST will solve). It also doesn‚Äôt include governmental/DoD contracts or the use of day passes. 

So to give you an idea of revenue potential: 

We don‚Äôt know how much AST will charge users for the service. We do know it will be cheap and accessible. The cheapest possible it will be is $2 ($1 to Ast and 1$ to MNO). I believe it will be double that. However I want to show you revenue potential with the most pessimistic of uptake/price.

So pessimistically we will have 560 mill users (remember this doesn‚Äôt include dead zone users, governmental contracts, day passes and it is a pessimistic 20% uptake). AST will pessimistically be getting $1 dollar per month form each user or $12 yearly (I believe it will be at least 1.5 times more than that, maybe twice as much). So 560X12 = revenue of 6.7 billion with net profit of around 5 billion due to high margins. With a conservative 25 PE that with mean a market cap of 125 billion. Again, even allowing for a pessimistic 10% more dilution this would equate to a share price of 420 when fully operational. They should be fully operational by 2028. So doing the maths as pessimistically as possible I get a 420 share price. While this share price may sound crazy, considering ASTS is currently 11.50 per share or so, it‚Äôs really not. Transhumanica have a 500 PT by 2030 and Deutsche Bank have a PT of 676 by 2027. Have you ever seen a firm slap a 60x PT on a stock?

Disclosure: I‚Äôm all in with 20k shares and intend on HODLing all until 2027 at least.

Edit: Re potential government contracts - first responders and the military have an obvious need to eliminate dead zones.

All DoD contracts go through Fairwinds Technology. Fairwinds Technology have tweeted about AST‚Äôs technology.

BOEING THOUGHTS,"Hi everyone,

A small-time rookie here. I'm looking for a long-term investment opportunity (3-4 years at least) that promises solid gains. While I aim to maintain a diverse portfolio, I'm considering allocating a substantial portion of my capital to a single company.

One company on my radar is Boeing. Despite the safety issues and incidents they've faced, I find it puzzling that their stock value remains significantly lower than its pre-pandemic levels, especially given the current surge in travel and vacationing among Americans. The demand for air travel is hitting record numbers.

With the public scrutiny over safety issues and the recent leadership shakeup, I'm hopeful that these problems will be resolved and Boeing's stock will return to pre-pandemic levels, offering a substantial gain.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think the aviation sector is poised for upliftment or if AI-based companies are going to take away all the capital and any chances of upliftment.

Unveiling the Hidden Signals: Decrypting Everyday Patterns for Stock Market Insights,"[example of everyday things ](https://preview.redd.it/4nwh331ivk9d1.jpg?width=492&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6615717804d2eee2a25d9fc78a0736aaa4494c0)

**Abstract:** This paper explores the pervasive presence of fractal and chaotic patterns in everyday objects and natural phenomena, drawing parallels with their manifestation in financial market dynamics. By elucidating how patterns observed in crumpled fabric, tree branches, and mountain ranges mirror those seen in stock market charts, this study unveils underlying principles that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. Understanding these connections not only enriches our theoretical frameworks of complexity and order but also holds profound implications for predictive modeling and strategic decision-making in financial markets.

**Introduction:** Patterns are fundamental to both natural systems and human-made constructs, influencing perception and predictive analytics across disciplines. In financial markets, identifying and interpreting patterns such as trend reversals, breakouts, and support-resistance levels is crucial for informed decision-making. Conversely, observations of fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics in everyday phenomena suggest a deeper coherence and underlying order that may inform novel insights in investment strategies.

**Literature Review:** Synthesizing seminal works from mathematics, physics, ecology, and finance, this review establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding fractal and chaotic patterns across diverse domains. Key concepts include self-similarity across scales, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the role of pattern recognition in human cognition and decision-making processes. By contextualizing these concepts within the realms of financial markets and natural phenomena, this review sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration into their interconnectedness and practical implications.

**Methodology:** This study employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advanced computational algorithms with qualitative analysis to identify and quantify fractal patterns in both financial data and visual representations of natural structures. Case studies include detailed analyses of crumpled fabrics, tree line formations, and mountainous topographies, where fractal dimensions and recurrence plots highlight structural similarities with market trends. Statistical validation ensures robustness in pattern identification, facilitating actionable insights and predictive modeling applications.

**Results and Discussion:** The findings underscore striking parallels between financial market dynamics and natural phenomena, revealing how fractal and chaotic patterns manifest universally. The crumpled fabric exhibits patterns resembling trend lines with breakouts and retracements, akin to market behaviors observed in asset prices. Analogously, natural structures such as tree branches and coastlines demonstrate fractal properties mirroring market volatility and trend formations. This holistic understanding not only enriches theoretical frameworks but also positions these insights as pivotal in informing strategic decision-making and risk management strategies in financial markets.

**Conclusion:** In conclusion, this paper posits fractal and chaotic patterns as foundational elements underlying complexity and order in both natural and financial systems. By elucidating their presence in everyday phenomena, from fabric folds to geological formations, we advance our understanding of predictive analytics and strategic foresight in investment management. Embracing this interdisciplinary perspective not only fosters innovation in financial analysis but also underscores the intrinsic unity and interconnectedness of diverse systems. As we navigate the complexities of global markets, harnessing the insights derived from fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics holds transformative potential in navigating uncertainty and unlocking hidden opportunities.",1719696217.0,example everyday things https preview redd 4nwh331ivk9d1 jpg width 492 format pjpg auto webp c6615717804d2eee2a25d9fc78a0736aaa4494c0 abstract paper explores pervasive presence fractal chaotic patterns everyday objects natural phenomena drawing parallels manifestation financial market dynamics elucidating patterns observed crumpled fabric tree branches mountain ranges mirror seen stock market charts study unveils underlying principles transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries understanding connections enriches theoretical frameworks complexity order also holds profound implications predictive modeling strategic decision making financial markets introduction patterns fundamental natural systems human made constructs influencing perception predictive analytics across disciplines financial markets identifying interpreting patterns trend reversals breakouts support resistance levels crucial informed decision making conversely observations fractal geometry chaotic dynamics everyday phenomena suggest deeper coherence underlying order may inform novel insights investment strategies literature review synthesizing seminal works mathematics physics ecology finance review establishes theoretical foundation understanding fractal chaotic patterns across diverse domains key concepts include self similarity across scales sensitivity initial conditions role pattern recognition human cognition decision making processes contextualizing concepts within realms financial markets natural phenomena review sets stage comprehensive exploration interconnectedness practical implications methodology study employs multidisciplinary approach integrating advanced computational algorithms qualitative analysis identify quantify fractal patterns financial data visual representations natural structures case studies include detailed analyses crumpled fabrics tree line formations mountainous topographies fractal dimensions recurrence plots highlight structural similarities market trends statistical validation ensures robustness pattern identification facilitating actionable insights predictive modeling applications results discussion findings underscore striking parallels financial market dynamics natural phenomena revealing fractal chaotic patterns manifest universally crumpled fabric exhibits patterns resembling trend lines breakouts retracements akin market behaviors observed asset prices analogously natural structures tree branches coastlines demonstrate fractal properties mirroring market volatility trend formations holistic understanding enriches theoretical frameworks also positions insights pivotal informing strategic decision making risk management strategies financial markets conclusion conclusion paper posits fractal chaotic patterns foundational elements underlying complexity order natural financial systems elucidating presence everyday phenomena fabric folds geological formations advance understanding predictive analytics strategic foresight investment management embracing interdisciplinary perspective fosters innovation financial analysis also underscores intrinsic unity interconnectedness diverse systems navigate complexities global markets harnessing insights derived fractal geometry chaotic dynamics holds transformative potential navigating uncertainty unlocking hidden opportunities,0.9451,2024-06-29

Albertsons (ACI) Undervalued due to merger.,"First off I know Grocery Store may be the least sexy industry ever. However, the current share price of ACI is roughly $19.75 and the merger sale price is 27.25. Assuming the merger goes through that's a 37.97% gain if the merger goes through. However, I see even more potential if the merger fails. A potential of 81.77% gain in a base case. The down side I see is the fact that the stock is probably going to slowly go down over the next few months until the merger decision goes through. There may be a slight uptick coming up on august as the merger trial begins.

Merger goes through: I think this is the less likely case and most people are assuming an incredibly 90%+ chance of the FTC denying this merger but, I think there is some fair reasoning why it might. 1) Walmart is huge. It holds so much market share the merger will still hold less than half of Walmart's market share and the merged company will be just slightly larger than Costco's market share. 2) The companies largely operate in different areas of the U.S. and have been working toward divesting certain stores where the competition would be stopped. 

Merger gets Denied: Probably more likely but, possibly the better outcome for investors. I've done a dcf and get a bear case of roughly $24, a base case of roughly $36, and a bull case of $60. I think since the merger began the company has been letting a lot of extra weight off and making the company more profitable. The companies share price is held down from the merger and the large amount of debt they took on to make the large dividend payment a year ago. The company however has shown it can handle the debt really well and are moving in a great direction.

**Metalworking Facing Higher Costs**

The PPI in Metalworking peaked to all time high percent change from year ago at 10% in September 2022. The YoY change has come down since then with the percent change at 4.9% for May 2024. This has decreased MSM‚Äôs gross profit dollar and margin from $411M to $388M and 43% to 42% from May 2022 to March 2024 respectively. MSM stock is down 26% from all time high back in October 2023. This high PPI is priced in the stock; the percent change from a year ago gradual decline can serve as a positive welcome for MSM moving forward as gross profit margins have started trending back upwards.

**Technical Analysis**

An inverse cup and handle pattern occurred during 2021 prior to October 20^(th), 2021. The earnings results were underwhelming, and the stock dropped near 5%. One can argue that there was also a head and shoulder pattern to suggest downside.

Now let‚Äôs compare to today. An inverse cup is present but without the handle and there is no clear head and shoulder pattern compared to October 2021. With the stock already down 26% the known headwinds for the company is already priced in ‚Äì a slight positive nudge on the call may be enough for the stock to increase this earnings on Tuesday before market open. The stock currently sits at $78.01 which is a key price support and resistance line.

The GF Value is currently suggesting MSM is Modestly Undervalued‚Ä¶ this is just to make me feel good.

ON RR soared on friday indicating a temporary liquidity drain,"Since monday the 17th of june, there has been inflows into the Over Night Reverse Repurchase agreement.

TSLA üìà NVDA üìâ,"I firmly believe that Tesla (TSLA) has the potential to reach $250 before August, and here's why:

Historical Performance of QQQ in July: Historically, July has been a strong month for the QQQ. Given this historical trend, I expect the bullish momentum in QQQ to influence Tesla‚Äôs price movement.

Capital Rotation from NVIDIA to Other Stocks: The recent surge in NVIDIA‚Äôs stock has captured significant investor interest. As the stock market operates in cycles, I anticipate a capital rotation where investors move profits from one high-performing stock to others. With NVIDIA‚Äôs impressive rally, it‚Äôs likely that investors will take profits and seek opportunities in other promising tech stocks like Tesla. This influx of capital can drive Tesla‚Äôs stock price higher. 

Combined FOMO from Robotaxi Event, Optimus, and Earnings: Tesla‚Äôs upcoming robotaxi event, the developments around Tesla Optimus, and its earnings report are all highly anticipated. The FOMO on potentially groundbreaking announcements related to Tesla‚Äôs advancements in autonomous driving technology and the Tesla Optimus robot, combined with the anticipation of positive earnings results, can create substantial buying pressure.

I‚Äôll keep you all updated as you tell me I‚Äôm wrong, I‚Äôve only just started trading last month with $500, but I‚Äôve been able to grow it pretty fast with NVIDIA puts and Tesla calls :)

PYPL DD Long,"Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Everyone trades at their own risk. This is solely my personal opinion. I do not receive any compensation for this. I am positioned in PYPL. I am a retail investor.

PayPal has experienced a significant decline in its stock price in recent weeks. In this due diligence, I aim to outline my market expectations for the next two to three weeks incorporating current data.

Market Expectation and Fundamental Reasons:
A key reason for PayPal's sell-off could be increasing competition, including from Apple Pay. This may lead to intensified competition and potential market share loss for PayPal. However, PayPal and Apple Pay may cater to different target audiences. Many individuals regularly use PayPal alongside their traditional bank accounts. I certainly do. Invest in companies whose products you use.

Current Valuation:
As of June 28, 2024, PayPal's stock price was $58.03 USD. The Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E) stands at 14.58, based on Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.98 USD. The Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S) is 1.99 and the Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B) is 2.93. Historically, PayPal appears significantly undervalued, given the average P/E ratio of the last nine years was 44.65.

Market Sentiment and Technical Analysis:
The overall market has shown positive performance in 2024, driven particularly by the 'Mag Seven' companies. However, market breadth remains constrained, indicating many stocks are still undervalued. A sector rotation in the second half of 2024 could benefit fintechs like PayPal, especially if interest rate expectations decline and AI technology is leveraged for efficiency gains.

Technical Indicators and Sentiment:
PayPal's Dealer Gamma Exposure (GEX) recently stood at -30, coupled with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicating an oversold market sentiment. Bullish divergence within the overarching bearish scenario suggests a possible bottom formation. Support zones in the technical picture reinforce this assumption. Historically, July has been an attractive month for PayPal with high returns. A near-panic sell-off could reverse sharply due to Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). A rapid upward movement.

The negative GEX could, in a highly unlikely scenario, catalyze a small Gamma Squeeze.

Volatility and Short Interest:
Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has decreased, interpreted as a bullish signal because it could possibly drop further. PYPL's volatility has also significantly decreased. Short interest for PayPal stands at approximately 2% of outstanding shares, relatively low, indicating moderate investor confidence. Open interest of put-call options also shows a relatively balanced positioning.

In summary, the analysis suggests PayPal has promising prospects despite short-term challenges. Fundamental and technical indicators support the belief that PayPal could see positive developments, particularly in July and throughout the year.

I anticipate broader market increases and sector rotations. Undervalued stocks are likely to gain momentum. Therefore, I am LONG on PYPL.",1719678414.0,disclaimer financial advice everyone trades risk solely personal opinion receive compensation positioned pypl retail investor paypal experienced significant decline stock price recent weeks due diligence aim outline market expectations next two three weeks incorporating current data market expectation fundamental reasons key reason paypal sell could increasing competition including apple pay may lead intensified competition potential market share loss paypal however paypal apple pay may cater different target audiences many individuals regularly use paypal alongside traditional bank accounts certainly invest companies whose products use current valuation june 28 2024 paypal stock price 58 03 usd price earnings ratio p e stands 14 58 based earnings per share eps 3 98 usd price sales ratio p 1 99 price book ratio p b 2 93 historically paypal appears significantly undervalued given average p e ratio last nine years 44 65 market sentiment technical analysis overall market shown positive performance 2024 driven particularly mag seven companies however market breadth remains constrained indicating many stocks still undervalued sector rotation second half 2024 could benefit fintechs like paypal especially interest rate expectations decline ai technology leveraged efficiency gains technical indicators sentiment paypal dealer gamma exposure gex recently stood 30 coupled relative strength index rsi indicating oversold market sentiment bullish divergence within overarching bearish scenario suggests possible bottom formation support zones technical picture reinforce assumption historically july attractive month paypal high returns near panic sell could reverse sharply due fear missing fomo rapid upward movement negative gex could highly unlikely scenario catalyze small gamma squeeze volatility short interest volatility measured vix decreased interpreted bullish signal could possibly drop pypl volatility also significantly decreased short interest paypal stands approximately 2 outstanding shares relatively low indicating moderate investor confidence open interest put call options also shows relatively balanced positioning summary analysis suggests paypal promising prospects despite short term challenges fundamental technical indicators support belief paypal could see positive developments particularly july throughout year anticipate broader market increases sector rotations undervalued stocks likely gain momentum therefore long pypl,0.9914,2024-06-29
Why I‚Äôm short TSLA and you should be too,"First their delivery numbers for Q3 will be lower than expectations, signaling continuing falling demand. This is after the price cuts, low interest rate offerings, and discounts. Demand just isn‚Äôt there and they do not have enough time to turn things around.


Margins keep getting tighter and tighter, falling to levels similar to other automotive companies. ‚ÄúBut but FSD and robotaxi‚Äù. FSD hasn‚Äôt had the perceived success they thought it would have - people just like driving their cars and the extra value isn‚Äôt there for the normal person. Robotaxi won‚Äôt be ready this year, I‚Äôd be surprised if it‚Äôs ready next year - this is the most obvious sell the news out there, especially based on Tesla‚Äôs track record of over-promising and hyping things up. 


They currently have nothing in their financials but ‚Äúhope‚Äù that signals a turnaround. Fundamentals clearly show TSLA is overpriced and I expect a tank in the near term. Oh and once the Delaware judge validates the attorney fees Tesla will have to pay those attorneys in billions worth of options which will almost assuredly be sold.

Chevron Decision - Everything just changed,"[https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-chevron-regulations-environment-4ae73d5a79cabadff4da8f7e16669929](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-chevron-regulations-environment-4ae73d5a79cabadff4da8f7e16669929)

The TLDR version is up till now courts would turn to federal regulators that could ""interpret"" ambiguous language however they wanted, essentially ""making up laws"". This is why, for example, the SEC can regulate crypto despite there being no clear-cut legislation. After this ruling, federal judges now have all the power, the regulators are cucked.

This feels like uncharted territory. Definitely going to have long lasting and far reaching implications for markets. Our entire legal system just changed overnight.

Smells bullish to me. Less regulation means more innovation. It also means your breakfast cereal will probably give you cancer. Exciting times ahead.

The reddest of red flags yet?,"A lot has been said about DJT. At the end most analysts seemed to have resigned to the idea, that it is a meme stock, disconnected from financial fundamentals or any real value, riding solely on emotions and support for Donald Trump. At best it was supposed to be a measurement of his followers fervor.

On Thursday, in the deep, deep shadows of everything else, that has happened during the debate and and the discussion about it, that idea died a quiet and lonely death.

If the assessment of DJT being a meme stock and riding the waves of confidence in Donald Trump held up, DJT should have gone through the roof. Instead, while there were small spikes, representing how much positive sentiment was present in the share price, the stock started sliding over Friday, once more sheddding a lot of it¬¥s superfluous value over the course of a single day.

As far as the idea of meme stocks go, this is a red flag, big enough to cover a May Parade in Moscow, while Paul Revere is galloping off and the beacons of Gondor are lit.

For example, I screenshotted the SPY IV and HV overlay. At the place where its circled the IV is 3 times higher than the HV. But becayse the Y axis is the percentage, these lines are overlapping rather than the HV line being way higher than the IV line.

Bank of America Raises Quarterly Dividend after passing Federal Reserve's Stress Test,"Bank of America Raised its quarterly dividend to 0.26 per share, and plans to issue structured financial products for several securities.

Bank of America's  will offer Structured Financial products on Wells Fargo stock, with a 10% annual yield.

Bank of America will check Well's Fargo's closing price on July 05 2024 to determine the reference price.

|| || |October 7, 2024|| |January 6, 2025|| |April 7, 2025|| |July 7, 2025|| |October 6, 2025|| |January 5, 2026|| |April 6, 2026|| |July 6, 2026|| |October 5, 2026|| |January 5, 2027|| |April 5, 2027|

If the closing price of Wells Fargo stock is below 44-46 per share on any of the above dates, the bond will be liquidated for a 100% loss. All coupon payments made prior to the liquidation will not be affected. If the price finishes above the July 05 2024 closing price on any of the above dates, the bond will be redeemed early and no further coupon payments will be made.

Bank of America will offer structured products for the S&P 500 index. The bond holder either gets a 13% return if the price of the index is higher than the reference price at maturity or their money back.

Infinite Money?????,"# The Plan: December 2026 Options

Options in Play:

1. Long Call: Buy the 18th Dec 2026 $540 Call
2. Short Call: Sell the 18th Dec 2026 $545 Call

# Why This Should Work

SPY's Historical Performance: SPY has a strong track record of growth. By 2026, there's a high probability that SPY will be well above our target price, especially given its historical resilience and growth patterns.

Break-Even Point**:** We set the break-even point just $1 above the current price. This is a conservative estimate, giving us a wide margin for profit.

# The Strategy: Call Debit Spread

By using a call debit spread, we can minimize our initial outlay while maximizing potential profits. Here's how:

1. Buy the $540 Call (Long Call)**:** This gives us the right to buy SPY at $540 by Dec 2026.
2. Sell the $545 Call (Short Call)**:** This obligates us to sell SPY at $545, capping our maximum profit but also reducing our initial cost.

# Final Thoughts

This strategy hinges on SPY's continued upward trajectory, which is a reasonable assumption given its historical performance. By setting our break-even point conservatively and leveraging a call debit spread, we can potentially unlock significant profits with a controlled risk. I also understand for this strategy to be effective; you would need to invest a considerably large capital to make some serious profit.

BYND is about to go BYND the moon.,"Remember when this stock ran up like 90 percent last earnings??? It wasn't because of the earnings... it was this.

Beyond Meat (BYND) is getting ATTACKED by shorts with a MASSIVE 39%+ short interest on its float. But guess what? On June 27th, BYND made its epic entrance onto the REGSHO INCLUSION LIST üöÄüí• and you know what that means... MOON TIME!

**What's regsho?** Glad you asked! According to Rule 203(c)(6) of Regulation SHO, a ""threshold security"" means:
- Fails to deliver 10,000+ shares for 5 straight days
- Fails equal to at least 0.5% of total shares outstanding
- Security is listed by a self-regulatory organization (SRO)

Basically, it's a list of heavily shorted stocks that need to cover their butts! üòú When BYND is on regsho, shorting is like trying to wrestle a bear in a phone booth. Liquidity is tight and borrowing costs are THROUGH THE ROOF (IBKR‚Äôs retail fee is a whopping 111.7216%! ü§ë). Even the big boys are paying around 15-20%, which is INSANE.

Now, here‚Äôs the JUICY part: after 13 trading days (T+13) on regsho, forced covering kicks in. That means shorts have to start buying back shares, which can send the price SKYROCKETING. üöÄüìà

Check this out: On Feb 7th, BYND hit regsho and leading up to T+13, the stock‚Äôs price climbed and CLIMBED, until BOOM üí•üí• they covered their shorts and the price went nuts! Happened again on Apr 25th ‚Äì stock price up, up, and AWAY until the shorts HAD to cover, causing another HUGE pump. üí£üí•

Fast forward to NOW: BYND hit regsho on June 27th and history tells us this baby‚Äôs got some big moves coming. Sure, they might not pump exactly on T+13, but they gotta cover eventually. We've seen it take up to a month before, but the trend is clear: regsho = PRICE EXPLOSION! üí•üí∞

My positions? 8c July 19th, 9c July 19th, 10c Aug 16th, 12c Aug 16th. This is the regsho cash cow cycle, folks. Milk it responsibly ü•õ.

BYND Regsho Cash Cow Cycle,"Beyond Meat (BYND) is a heavily shorted company as many of you are aware with a high short interest of 39%+ its float.

On the start of June 27 th trading day BYND entered the regsho inclusion list where the stock has huge price increases on regsho.

What is regsho?

As defined in Rule 203(c)(6) of Regulation SHO, a ‚Äúthreshold security‚Äù is any equity security of any issuer that is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or that is required to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (commonly referred to as reporting securities), where, for five consecutive settlement days:

ÔÇ∑ There are aggregate fails to deliver at a registered clearing agency of 10,000 shares or more per security;

ÔÇ∑ The level of fails is equal to at least one-half of one percent of the issuer‚Äôs total shares outstanding; and

ÔÇ∑ The security is included on a list published by a self-regulatory organization (SRO).

A security ceases to be a threshold security if it does not exceed the specified level of fails for five consecutive settlement days.

A security can be added on this because the failures to settle can be a sign of high shorting and improper naked short selling as you can see from the stock‚Äôs high short interest.

When BYND is on regsho it is extremely hard to short with limited liquidity and the high cost to borrow rate (IBKR‚Äôs retail fee

currently at 111.7216%), there is also a prime rate but that‚Äôs for the bigger players probably around 15-20% which is extremely high regardless. This can lead to an increase in the price of BYND.

After T+13 (13 trading days after its been included to the list) force covering begins where they are forced to cover the amount on the first day of regsho inclusion until the stock is off regsho.

The last two times BYND has been on Regsho the shorts ran the stock up on t+13 th day.

[BYND Chart and regsho trading days](https://preview.redd.it/lce8w2oo8d9d1.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc37f1671f306c73c0986791d6c8a54739857199)

As you can see on feb7th BYND entered regsho (see teal lines on chart) and leading up to t+13 the stock‚Äôs price gradually increased and the t+13 th day they decided to cover all their obligations which lead to a huge pump.

This happened to be also the earnings day of bynd where they decided to use earnings as a cover.

FC on the chart stands for forced covering where they have to force cover their obligations.

FC +1 means they have to cover whats due on the first day of regsho.

FC +2 means they have to cover what‚Äôs due on the 2 nd day of regsho. Etc.

Fast forward to the last time BYND was on regsho on Apr25th (see purple lines on chart). Again the stock‚Äôs price increased leading to the t+13 th day of regsho where on the t+13 th day they covered majority of their obligations which lead to the huge pump

Now BYND has entered regsho on June 27 th where the regsho just about started. In the past this has lead to a huge priceincrease in the stock as the shorts are now incentivized to get off the regsho list by covering their obligations. Mind you they might not run the stock up on the t+13 th trading day, it could be earlier or later where they wait for earnings on Aug 1st or after it. Also the November regsho run it took 1month for them to run it up

So we got BYND on regsho and ETF FTDs that are coming due.

My Positions are: 8c July 19th , 9c July 19th , 10c Aug16th, 12c Aug16th

This is a regsho cash cow cycle. Milk responsibly.

Also this is not financial advice.

It's clear their offering hits on this with less expensive trendy products (think unbranded Stanley Mugs, Prime drinks, and popular character licensed gear). I love this place for the ability to get useful items but not break the bank. What used to be designate as a trip to Target has shifted to Five instead where we spend a fraction of the cost, get effectively the same things, and don‚Äôt have to walk past dozens of irrelevant departments.

While the offering is a unique focus that helps them build brand and drive store expansion, there is a ton of opportunity left on the table to cater to others in the family. Dollar stores also are hot for being recession proof.¬†¬†

FIVE hasn‚Äôt even completed expansion in the US, notably they have no stores in the Pacific Northwest. Not to mention there has been no international expansion. Their expansion has come with no debt, new stores have minimal build out since fixtures are so basic and the merchandising aligns to a warehouse style clean look. The footprint works at nearly any size and they can slot into countless open leases as other retailers struggle in a downturn and are forced to close stores.

**Financials and Other DD**:

Four years ago one user wrote some great DD ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv05tm/five\_below\_going\_to\_drop\_hard\_on\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv05tm/five_below_going_to_drop_hard_on_earnings/)) and suggested buying puts since they had just made distribution center investment, couldn‚Äôt sustain store growth. Since that post they‚Äôve grown store count by 75%, grown comparable store sales by 20% ($2.0M>$2.5M), grown EPS +144% ($2>$5+), peaked at +100% stock price ($108>$215), and are now trading at the same SAME value ($108).

There is already an approved outstanding $100M buyback that has been untouched. For a company delivering $5 EPS already it‚Äôs easy to see how a growth motivated leadership team would execute on this even if the rest of the store & revenue growth slows down. In the past few years they‚Äôve done similar buy-backs at an average cost between $158-$162/share so no doubt they‚Äôll be executing this and likely green lighting more.

Part of the value of Five Below is that the stores are easy to open, allowing for fast store growth. The footprint is only 9500 sq ft, which makes them easy to locate in dozens of struggling shopping areas where they can take over leases. Typically they are spending <$400k to open a store and have a one-year payback on the investment. Even after completing plans to expand to 3k stores with this model there is tons of room for new concepts of smaller or larger footprints that leverage the same distribution network they are building. Not that places like Dollar General has around 20k stores while even original WSB darlings have 6k+ stores.

50Day moving average just touched the 200day moving average

**Is it Just ‚Äú$5 and Below‚Äù**:

No. The core SKU offering is based on quality low priced goods, primarily $5-$10.¬† That said my local store has expanded their ‚ÄúFive Beyond‚Äù in-store footprint to be \~25% of the square footage. There is plenty of upside to drive total $ per store up which would have a huge impact given that this metric has been flat over the past 24 months. Management has already said they expect this to drop in the short term, but this is baked into the guidance.

It‚Äôs been 5 years since ‚Äú5 Below‚Äù moved to price some items over $5 and growth has still been solid. Despite the name there is no backlash to not adhering to a hard $5 cap on items and even in the face of inflation there are dozens of entry level items that will continue to be available at this price.

A big knock on the stock is that it is a physical retailer with minimal online presence. This makes sense though, even the behemoth Amazon struggles to compete in goods priced at this level. It‚Äôs nearly impossible for Amazon to make $$ on <$10 items due to shipping and the huge cost of returns. It‚Äôs a defensible fall back to have physical stores and funding a distribution network from this is a great move. Again I see this as a growth potential as they expand the price point of their offering distribution network that serves 1500+ retail locations in the continental US serves as a great basis to handle ecommerce orders reliably.¬†

**Risks**:

* The biggest hit to guidance came with notes about shrinkage being on the rise. This makes sense, the local store is often staffed by a single individual and tons of items are small and easy to hide.¬†
* Retail is a hard business. Specialty shops have their place but FIVE still has yet to show they can expand outside of trends/tweens.¬†
* Inventory management is hard. With store growth FIVE has better negotiating terms with suppliers, but also risks over buying trend items and having to discount them. Recent articles from Q2 earnings note difficulties here for things like Squishmallows and Faux Stanley cups (both driven by TikTok trends). Toys, Seasonal, and Trends are notorious for this but again here expanding out of just the Tween market to offer commodities for all helps reduce this risk as would a more ‚Äúseek and find‚Äù approach of under buying trend items and making them foot traffic drivers with regular restocks. At the same time when other retailers over load on inventory with classic channel stuffing from manufacturers Five Below is in a position to gobble that up and resell it in their stores. Places like Ross Stores (equal store count but 10x market cap thanks to larger store foot print) have done great with this model.

"$VFC, in Bracken we trust ü§ù","
My thesis:

VF Corp has undoubtedly made some regarded decisions the past couple years, but the turnaround starts now and this is the bottom. 

Every move they have made in the past year tells me this thing is going to turn around in a big way. 

 They brought in the turnaround goat himself, Bracken Darrell who has a history of saving big name companies in the likes of Logitech and Old spice.  This guy knows how to balance a sheet and return good brands to flavortown.  And this mf believes in the stock, he has bought over $2 milli worth of shares in the past couple months.  And on a $1.3 million dollar salary that‚Äôs no small amount.  He also brought in Sun Choe, the Lulu creative director, that gets white women everywhere bleeding their bank accounts to buy her clothes.  So the leadership team is stacked from a business and creative standpoint.  

They also announced they‚Äôre looking to deleverage by selling one of their brands (likely supreme) and I think when this goes through it‚Äôs going to be a big mover.  It‚Äôs a negative on the balance sheet, but it‚Äôs attractive enough to warrant a good price.  When they get supreme off the books, the stock is going to jump, it‚Äôs just a question of when it is announced and how high the stock goes.   If it happens in the near term, the 13% short interest is going to lead to a lot of covering and this thing is going to boom.

Rivian Founder in for a great deal if stocks huts 295$ per share,"2021 Equity Award to our Founder & Chief Executive Officer

In January 2021, our board of directors and stockholders approved an equity award to Dr. Scaringe consisting of a time-based option to purchase 6,785,315 shares of our Class A common stock and a performance-based option to purchase up to 20,355,946 shares of our Class A common stock (the ‚Äú2021 CEO Equity Award‚Äù).

Our board of directors, in consultation with an independent compensation consultant, considered a number of factors in determining whether to grant the 2021 CEO Equity Award as well as the terms and conditions with respect thereto. Such factors include Dr. Scaringe‚Äôs then-current ownership interest in the Company, external market data for similarly situated executives among comparable companies, and the Company‚Äôs interest in incentivizing Dr. Scaringe to deliver on the Company‚Äôs strategy and align his long-term interests with those of our stockholders.

The time-based option vests in six equal installments on each of the first through sixth anniversaries of a Qualified IPO (as defined in the award agreement), subject to Dr. Scaringe‚Äôs continued service. The performance-based option vests in twelve installments contingent on the achievement of four stock price goals over a performance period that commences on the later of: (i) the sixth anniversary of the grant date and (ii) a Qualified IPO and ends upon the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The four stock price goals are, on a price-per share basis, $110, $150, $220, and $295, in each case as adjusted to reflect the impact of any stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalization or other changes in the corporate structure of the Company. Such stock prices reflect performance-based goals of approximately 5x to 13x increases in our stock price based on the $21.72 exercise price at the time of grant in January 2021.

Achievement of the stock price goals will be assessed on each of three assessment dates: the sixth, eighth and nine-year and sixth month anniversaries of the grant date.

The options each have a ten-year term and generally become exercisable as they vest. The options are also subject to certain forfeiture and accelerated vesting provisions with respect to all or a portion of the award in the event of a change of control, the definition of which does not include a public offering, termination of service to the Company and change in title from Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman or any other C-level title.

Need Advice/Feedback,"I started trading beginning of May 2023, just over a year now. I have a win rate over 65% but have lost over 7k. I just feel so defeated as I have not had a green month yet, feel like I am just getting worse. I mostly trade options, I like to use the Golden Zone for my entries. I can paper trade successfully with easy 20-30% gains, I take it to the real thing and lose it all. If I set my SL, the trade comes down hits my SL and goes right up past my TP. Whenever I don't set my SL it comes down and just keeps going down. If I avg down everything falls apart, If I don't avg down it seems to come back close to my entry, where if I did avg down would've been profitable. If I take the loss, it will just keep going past my entry. And yep you guessed it, If I don't take the loss maybe it keeps going, nope will turn around and die. I could sit here and say ""oh every time I do this the opposite happens blah blah"" but really its just my dumbass not staying patient or just being stupid and revenge trading. I have a couple trades each month that completely destroy my whole gains and eventually my port. I feel like If I keep going I am just going to eventually lose everything. I am just hoping someone else has been in this boat before and can give me some advice or just tell me the harsh reality that I can't do this, get out now. I deposit up around 1k at a time because I figure if I can work a small account I can work a bigger account, maybe just screwing myself. Half of these losses are from SPX, I am done with SPX until I have a bigger account.

"How to know which way to play earnings, every time.","Robinhood Gold users know all about the Morningstar report at the bottom of every stock's page that states their opinion of the stock's fair market value according to their ""research.""

Don't worry, you don't need to actually read anything or do any research to win. Just remember this: it's false info meant to manipulate the retail market into picking the opposite direction the stock is going.

**Example:** Morningstar, professionals as they are, proclaim that Nike's fair market value is $129. The average Robinhood user will see this and think to themselves, ""Oh wow, Nike is only at $94 today going into earnings... that must mean it's undervalued and about to skyrocket once efficient markets kick in... What a steal, I should buy calls or shares!"" The only problem is: Nike nosedived after earnings today, going even lower to $88 vs it's ""fair market value"" of $129.

I've done a little experiment and tracked which way earnings have gone depending on the FMV. My theory was that the stock will continue to go in the direction it's already going vs the FMV.

Here are the results of my experiment (6 for 6) -

FMV = Fair Market Value Before Earnings,
Price DBE = Price Day Before Earnings,
Price DAE = Price Day After Earnings

- Nike: FMV $129, Price DBE $94, Price DAE $88 (so far), PUTS win
- FedEx: FMV $240, Price DBE $256, Price DAE $296, CALLS win
- Broadcom: FMV $1350, Price DBE $1493, Price DAE $1678, CALLS win
- Salesforce: FMV $300, Price DBE $272, Price DAE $218, PUTS win
- Walgreens: FMV $33, Price DBE $15, Price DAE $12, PUTS win
- Lululemon: FMV $285, Price DBE $308, Price DAE $323, CALLS win

There are of course counterexamples (Micron), but from what I've seen, it's pretty uncanny and very predictable which way a stock will go based on if the FMV is below the price (it'll keep going up) or above the price (it'll keep going down). I bet someone with more time on their hands could pull these same 3 numbers for every major earnings example, and see what the percentages are of the price following this pattern.

Not financial advice; I just have basic pattern recognition and ADHD.

My next play: First Solar (FSLR) - FMV $185, PBE $250 as of today, so my position is 7/26 $285 calls. (Earnings 7/25)

DD FCX,"Due Diligence: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)

**Executive Summary**
Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by the surging demand for copper, which is a critical component in the technology and renewable energy sectors. As a leading global copper producer, FCX is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing needs of AI companies, tech startups, and the broader electrification trend.

**1. Growing Demand for Copper**

A. Technology Sector and AI Boom

- **AI and Tech Startups**: The AI boom and the proliferation of tech startups are driving significant demand for copper. Copper is essential for the manufacturing of semiconductors, wiring, and other electronic components used in AI infrastructure and devices.
- **Data Centers**: The expansion of data centers, necessary to support AI workloads, further increases copper demand for electrical wiring and cooling systems.

B. Renewable Energy and Electrification

- **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: The shift towards electric vehicles is a major copper demand driver. EVs use significantly more copper than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles due to their electric motors, batteries, and charging infrastructure.
- **Renewable Energy**: Copper is critical in renewable energy systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines, as well as in the grid infrastructure required to distribute renewable energy.

**2. Strong Production Capabilities**

A. Diversified Asset Portfolio

- **Major Mines**: FCX operates some of the largest and most productive copper mines globally, including the Grasberg mine in Indonesia and the Morenci mine in Arizona. These assets provide a robust production base and economies of scale.
- **Geographic Diversity**: The company's mining operations span across multiple geographies, reducing risk and exposure to any single region.

B. Production Expansion Plans

- **Capacity Expansion**: FCX is actively investing in expanding its production capacity to meet rising copper demand. Projects like the Grasberg underground transition are set to significantly boost output.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency and cost management are expected to enhance profitability and cash flow.

 **3. Favorable Market Conditions**

A. Copper Price Trends

- **Price Appreciation**: Copper prices have shown a strong upward trend driven by supply constraints and increasing demand. Analysts project continued price appreciation, benefiting major producers like FCX.
- **Inflation Hedge**: Investing in copper producers can serve as a hedge against inflation, as commodity prices often rise with inflationary pressures.

B. Supply Constraints

- **Limited New Supply**: The development of new copper mines is capital-intensive and time-consuming, leading to limited new supply coming online in the near term. This supply constraint supports higher copper prices.
- **Sustainable Practices**: FCX‚Äôs commitment to sustainable and responsible mining practices positions it favorably with regulatory bodies and environmentally conscious investors.

**4. Financial Strength and Shareholder Value**

A. Strong Financial Position:

- **Revenue and Profit Growth**: FCX has demonstrated strong revenue and profit growth, driven by high copper prices and efficient production.
- **Healthy Balance Sheet**: The company maintains a robust balance sheet with manageable debt levels, providing financial stability and flexibility.

B. Shareholder Returns

- **Dividends and Buybacks**: FCX has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Continued strong financial performance is likely to support ongoing shareholder returns.
- **Investment in Growth**: Strategic investments in expanding production and improving operational efficiency are expected to drive long-term value creation for shareholders.


**Conclusion**
Investing in Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) offers a strategic opportunity to gain exposure to the booming demand for copper driven by the AI revolution, technology advancements, and the global shift towards renewable energy. FCX‚Äôs strong production capabilities, favorable market conditions, financial strength, and commitment to shareholder value make it a compelling choice for investors seeking growth and stability in the commodities sector.


TLDR: booming AI/tech needs copper. These markets keep growing so more copper needed. FCX produces a lot of copper.

Added benefit it is also used a lot in the market of renewable energy which is also getting a lot of support. Getting in this business is also costly to set up so they kind of have a moat built up through that.

Carvana is getting squeezed,"A lot of people were convinced, and are still convinced (including myself), that Carvana is a dogshit business that is overvalued and that the stock will eventually crash. There has been convincing short seller research publicized with the short sellers taking hefty positions in Carvana at much lower prices compared to where Carvana is now. Everyone has been expecting Carvana to crash back down by now but it hasn't. You see, short positions have inherent risks that long positions don't have and the risks have to be actively managed. The market has been very strong recently and short sellers as an aggregate have been suffering. Based on recent price action, it seems like short sellers are reaching capitulation and are decreasing their short positions or entirely closing them out. I think Carvana is seeing unusually strong price action because short sellers are capitulating and closing out their shorts, resulting in higher and higher prices. 

I don't have a position in Carvana yet. I don't blindly short stocks without a catalyst in mind or some other way that I can determine if I'm right or wrong. If the market continues to be very strong, Carvana might continue to squeeze further. It's heavily shorted with the shorts being significantly underwater. One thing that should kill the squeeze is massive dilution, which should happen at some point. The family that controls Carvana is also pretty shady and I wouldn't put it past them to orchestrate a squeeze, sell their own shares, and then issue massive dilution after.

Walgreens,"Hey everyone,

I'm thinking about buying Walgreens (WBA) stock, but I'm not sure if it's a good move right now. Walgreens dropped by about 25% in a single day recently, and I'm curious about the reasons behind it and if it might be undervalued now.

Here's what I've found so far:
- The drop happened after Walgreens reported a 25% year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings for Q3 2024. This was due to weaker consumer demand and some impairment charges from recent acquisitions
- some analysts think Walgreens is undervalued, estimating its fair value at around $24 per share, which is about 50% higher than its current price
- Walgreens has a high dividend yield of around 8.38%, which is great for dividend lovers like me. But they did cut their quarterly dividend from $0.48 to $0.25 per share recently 
- They're trying to stabilize revenue through cost-cutting and acquisitions, like Summit Health and Village MD, which seem promising
- There are also broader economic concerns like high oil prices and interest rates that could impact their performance 

So, given all this, do you think Walgreens is a good buy for a long-term, dividend-focused investor? Would love to hear your thoughts and any additional insights! Thanks!",1719514503.0,hey everyone thinking buying walgreens wba stock sure good move right walgreens dropped 25 single day recently curious reasons behind might undervalued found far drop happened walgreens reported 25 year year decline adjusted earnings q3 2024 due weaker consumer demand impairment charges recent acquisitions analysts think walgreens undervalued estimating fair value around 24 per share 50 higher current price walgreens high dividend yield around 8 38 great dividend lovers like cut quarterly dividend 0 48 0 25 per share recently trying stabilize revenue cost cutting acquisitions like summit health village md seem promising also broader economic concerns like high oil prices interest rates could impact performance given think walgreens good buy long term dividend focused investor would love hear thoughts additional insights thanks,0.9888,2024-06-27

Are we approaching the end of supermarkets due to increased shrink? And is Costco membership model the way of the future?,"With Walgreens $WBA preparing to shut down hundreds more of their underperforming stores in the US. I wanted to look at shrink levels of Costco.  


One of the first articles I came by from last month lays it out pretty good so I'll just copy some of the data from there. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/how-costco-limits-retail-theft-checks-reciepts-2023-5


>Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, and other major retailers have warned of rising theft rates plaguing stores across the US.

>But one company appears to be immune to the problem: Costco.

>The warehouse chain's chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, said Thursday that **shrinkage ‚Äî or inventory losses due to theft, fraud, or other causes ‚Äî was largely unchanged.**

> Galanti said the company saw a slight increase after the rollout of self-checkout three years ago, but those rates have since reverted to the longer-term trend.

> *T*arget**, meanwhile, has said its losses from shrinkage will balloon to more than **$1 billion in 2023, up $500 million over last year.** Walmart's CEO said in December that stores would close if theft didn't slow. Dollar Tree said this week that it was considering locking up more goods in stores as it faces rising shrink.

>Overall, theft helps drive about **$95 billion in losses every year for US retailers,** according to estimates by the National Retail Federation, an industry group.



Costco has personal information on every customer that goes through their door. Their products are in bulky large packages. and so on... 

Gist of the matter is that lack of shrinkage these days is a huge competitive advantage which directly translates to increased profits. The more competition's stores close the more shoppers Costco gets. They can reduce prices more if they need to or keep selling it at the same price as their competition. It looks like they've cornered the market for the time being. 

Obviously dollar stores are leeches that prey on small towns in the US and they are unlikely to be affected by this. But how can Walmart for example keep growing or even prevent loss of revenue over the next few years until perhaps this theft trend changes. 


Another player in this category is BJ's Wholesale Club. With larger potential for growth and a much lower PE ratio (less than half) I believe a combination of these two stocks will be guaranteed winners in the next few years.

Normally I would stay the fuck away from cannabis stocks because I believe market dynamics of legalization will continue bring prices and margins down significantly.

Nvidia: The only problem you're gonna have is that you didn't sell more.,"**Introduction**

Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio ‚Äì it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins.

**Growing Competition**

First off, the competition is heating up big time. üî• AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machineüëª‚Äã 

**Lowered Margins**

Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. üìâ

https://preview.redd.it/wqo1b0dno19d1.png?width=302&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5e2aede9241706468a2d6f0a1b8b3cc4737ea25

Adding to the heat, TSMC is thinking about jacking up production fees for Nvidia. The chairman's plans to raise prices could eat away at Nvidia's margins even more. If TSMC hikes those fees, Nvidia might have to dig deeper into their pockets, and that could be a real pain in the margins. üí∏ [Link (06/04)](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/TSMC-s-new-chairman-weighs-raising-production-fees-for-Nvidia)

So yeah, Nvidia's stock might be flying high right now, but with all this competition and pressure on margins, it might not stay that way for long. It's looking like Nvidia might be headed from tendies to tears if they can't keep up. üòÇ

**TL;DR**

Nvidia is trading high, but AMD, Intel, and Amazon are bringing the heat. üî• Competition + TSMC price hikes = potential margin squeeze. Stock might go from üöÄ to üí• if they don't keep up. üòÇ

"Grindr Investor Day Recap, Revenue Guidance, & Long Term Vision","Grindr, the LGBTQ+ dating app, today has announced the biggest changes in its 15-year history, promising to deliver a ""Gayborhood in your pocket""

Grindr CEO George Arison has outlined plans for the location-based app will launch a new feature called ""Roam"" allowing users to temporarily place their profile in a new location ahead of a trip, in order to plan that trip.

* He also wants Grindr to connect its users to services, from restaurants to [fitness and health professionals](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/02/grindr-hires-athena-expansion), offered with a ""Grindr seal of approval.""
* ""Do you want to find a LGBTQ-friendly GP or therapist? Grindr will do that for you,"" Arison said.
* Users will also gain more options to differentiate their profiles: Someone looking for friends in a new city won't have to wade through everyone using the app for casual sex.
* The changes are being tested now in several markets and Grindr expects to launch them fully later this year.

Users have been ""hacking"" the app by inventing new uses for it --- from sourcing travel tips to monkeypox vaccines ---even though the app infrastructure itself barely changed.

* ""We're working to meet our users where they are,"" Arison said, ""We had not added any enhanced features for a number of years.""

Grindr currently around 14 million monthly active users worldwide, and a market capitalization of around $2 billion.

* Arison also said Grindr's growth markets are Latin America and Asia, but added ""In the US, almost 30% of Gen Z adults identify as queer. All of these people will need a tool for connecting with others.""

On AI:

* ""AI will fundamentally change how dating will be done, creating better ways of making connections --- and our users will decide exactly how,"" he said.
* ""We need to lead them there, through the opportunity to participate in piloting features, and giving users a clear choice of whether they want to use this technology.""

Here are is the new revenue & earnings guidance, which is conservative because it doesn't include the contributions from expansion opportunities, which is where I think the real opportunity lies.

Share buybacks? Another dividend raise? I don't fucking know - all I see is Jensen feasting on this joke of a spinach dip over the past week. Even the Wall Street regards are dropping price targets north of $170, couple at $200 already.

Jensen has said on multiple occasions now - GTC first, and the iNveStoR's meeting (regards) today - ""Blackwell will be the most successful product launch in NVDA's history"". The CoWos advanced packaging tech from TSMC increased production capacity sizably, which is starting to lead to higher than expected revenue projections for Blackwell this year. 

Then there's the GB200 set for launch in the fall.

  
Anyway, not to digress too much - my post history is entirely NVDA due diligence at this point, so see that if you need catching up on other recent NVDA announcements. 

Otherwise the read is simple enough even for regards like me after watching GTC. Especially so after he started getting asked for titty signatures.

Chewy believes today‚Äôs Repurchase is an accretive use of capital and provides an efficient mechanism to repurchase shares at a discount to the current market price, while further reducing the ownership position of the Company‚Äôs largest shareholder. Chewy‚Äôs increasing profitability and free cash flow generation enables the Company to further optimize its capital allocation strategy through this transaction, which comes in addition to the recently announced $500 million share repurchase program. This transaction together with the Company‚Äôs share repurchase program underscores the confidence Chewy has in the business and its compelling growth and margin expansion strategy. In light of Chewy‚Äôs expanding free cash flow generation, the Company will continue to assess options to opportunistically return cash to its shareholders.

Dear Future Self,"Current net worth : -$5000

The future can‚Äôt be delayed and is inevitable, You made it.
I see you are well off. I see mom and dad are taken care of. You are off the bus, driving a Black Benz. You are not working overtime mopping floors and cleaning toilets just to barely afford to rent someone‚Äôs basement.

The Universe never lied about a vision of a hungry man. You were a hungry young man in this vast universe but now, now the universe is within you. Remember this.

That‚Äôs what I gave you. I‚Äôve set a chain of events in motion that got you here. 
Sorry to put you through the up and downs and the coarse nature of the path I set you on, but that‚Äôs the only way to reach the top - risk falling off the cliff. Bet you learned some shit. You‚Äôre welcome.
Just remember, you were here in somebody‚Äôs basement . You couldn‚Äôt afford school. You were in a foreign land, you‚Äôve made it your home,a fish out of water, you haven‚Äôt seen your family in over a decade and counting. When you were serving at a restaurant, rich Highschool classmates acted like they don‚Äôt know you and left you $1 tip, you swallowed your tears as you wiped their table after they left. You couldn‚Äôt afford medicine for your mother. You were hungry. You cried to sleep, woke up in the morning to do a 15 hour shift. Women ignored you, old ‚Äúfriends‚Äù disrespected you when they saw you at the bus stop. You were lonely, your birthdays never existed, nobody made a toast to your health. Nobody invited you to Christmas, Thanksgiving or to parties. Don‚Äôt forget you wiped your tears off your phone screen as you typed this. 

But now you‚Äôre here. You‚Äôve made it. I trust you‚Äôve found a good woman and a great network of people who care about you and your purpose.
Now that you‚Äôre living in affluence,I hope greed didn‚Äôt consume your battered soul. Don‚Äôt forget to help others. All the opulence is vain if you are not sharing it.

"Bird flu vaccination recommendation tomorrow? Livestream and Agenda: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting, June 26-28","$CSL.AX $MRNA $PFE $BNTX $CVAC

""The ACIP develops recommendations for U.S. immunizations, including ages when vaccines should be given, number of doses, time between doses, and precautions and contraindications.""

This is the first ACIP meeting since H5N1 avian influenza has been detected in cows. The meeting agenda is typical for this time of the year, except it includes an update on H5N1 avian influenza.

Finland as the first country worldwide will start to vaccinate high risk groups like fur farm workers against H5N1 next week with vaccines from CSL. This is a response to outbreaks on at least 70 fur farms. [Source](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/finland-start-bird-flu-vaccinations-humans-2024-06-25)

As part of a recent agreement between 15 European Union member states, HERA, and CSL, Ireland will receive vaccine doses for high risk groups this year. [Source](https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/ireland-to-receive-vaccines-for-people-at-higher-risk-of-bird-flu/)

H5N1 avian influenza has been detected in more than 100 dairy cattle herds and the H5N1 risk for dairy farm workers is elevated. Three infected farm workers have been identified and more cases are suspected. [Source](https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/26/bird-flu-outbreak-avian-flu-containment-h5n1-eradication-in-cattle/)

In May the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) has ordered 4.8 million vaccine doses for humans in the USA against the H5N1 strain circulating in cows, which CSL will deliver this summer. [Source](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/csl-seqirus-scores-4th-award-us-government-bird-flu-pandemic-preparedness)

""Moderna and Pfizer are each in the process of competing for federal contracts to build a national stockpile of mRNA vaccines targeted toward the new bird flu amid mounting concerns it may be spreading among humans."" [Source](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/3022322/moderna-pfizer-competing-hhs-bid-mrna-vaccines-bird-flu/)

Last time H5N1 avian influenza significantly influenced several stocks, it looked like this:

""In response to the reports, shares of Moderna, Pfizer, Novavax NVAX, CureVac CVAC and BioNTech rose 13.7%, 3.6%, 5.3%, 18.8% and 11.1%, respectively, on Wednesday.""

""CureVac N.V. shares (CVAC) were up 25% Wednesday, while Moderna Inc. stock (MRNA) gained 14% and BioNTech SE's American depositary receipts (BNTX) were up more than 10%.""

"GDEV: high-growth creator of Hero Wars & PixelGun3D with an overweight $5 PT
","Here is some research I've gathered and compiled on the video game company GDEV/GDEVW and would like to share. Your feedback & commentary are most appreciated.

Disclosure: I‚Äôm long with 20 000 shares.

**TL;DR**

GDEV is one of the largest pure-play free-to-play (F2P) mobile and PC video game companies by bookings. It has a portfolio of large genre-leading franchises such as MMoRPG Hero Wars, FPS Pixel Gun 3D and puzzle game Island Hopper which position it well in a market that increasingly favours large brands and scale. Organic bookings and sales growth accelerated to +4% and +10%, respectively, in Q1 ‚Äò24 and Q4 ‚Äò23 representing the fastest growth of any peers.¬†

Record high audience expansion due to marketing efficiency with platform commission expense decreasing to a historically low level of 21.9%.¬† Share of the PC market has increased to 38% with 14 million Monthly Active Users (MAU) +17% year-over-year on all platforms.

Company is trading at a ridiculously cheap bargain price of 2$ at a valuation of 4x EV/EBITDA (peers 12x) and 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) with high insider ownership.

**Cliff notes**

GDEV has three key franchises, under which it has several titles:

Hero Wars: Alliance (mobile, Hero wars: Dominion Era (PC), Island Hoppers (mobile and PC), Pixel Gun 3D (mobile and PC). GDEV has several games in development set to launch from late 2024 onwards. All franchises continue to deliver growth.¬†

With several growth levers at its disposal, Cantor expects GDEV to deliver mid to high single digit organic growth in 2024-2025, with potential for 10% growth, positioning GDEV with one of the highest organic growth outlooks in the peer group. As GDEV invests for growth, we believe their margins (2% EBITDA and 4% FCF in 2024) to climb to 20%-30% in the medium term. GDEV trades on a 0.5x EV/Sales versus peers on 1.5x, 4x EV/EBITDA versus peers 12x (ROVIO was bought by SEGA at 20x EV/EBITDA in 2023), with 40% of its equity value in balance sheet cash ($174m).

Cantor Fitzgerald has initiated coverage of GDEV with an outperform rating and a minimum $5 price target. They highlight that GDEV returned to positive organic bookings and revenue growth in Q4 2023 and will continue to deliver consistent positive mid to high single digit organic growth through 2024-2025 driven by robust user acquisition spending, a growing active and paying user base in existing titles and new game launches.¬†

Last but not least, GDEV has taken advantage of the market rout of 2023 and undergone a buy-back offer at 2$ to purchase undervalued shares which reduced its float by 17 million shares.

[FY2023 summary](https://preview.redd.it/0khj6uk4vy8d1.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=a34536ad8e4799ecbf744a9c2053b02846d2031a)

**Investment Thesis**

* Mobile and PC free-to-play market has stabilized after two years of declines, with growth resuming in late 2023 and Q1 24, and continuing into Q2 24.
* GDEV‚Äôs portfolio of genre-leading franchises, large user base and leading UA expertise leave it well positioned in a market that continues to favour large, established brands and scale publishers.
* Organic bookings growth accelerated to +4% in Q1 24. With several growth levers, organic growth is expected to accelerate to even 10% by FY 24-25.
* EBITDA margins will remain in the high single digit in FY 24-25 due to the investment, but long-term margins should reach 20%-30% offering material long-term profit upside
* With 40% of its market cap in cash, GDEV trades on a 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) and has balance sheet optionality.
* The company is trading at around 4x EV/adj. EBITDA, which is way below peer valuations. It also generates decent cash flows from operations with a price target of at least 5$, an upside of 100%.

[Cash Generating Capabilities](https://imgur.com/afbS2KC)

**History**

The company has certainly come a long way from its humble beginnings in 2010, which is when its founders first met. At the start of that decade, Fadeev was running a social games development studio, Progrestar, while Boris Gertsovskiy was putting the finishing touches to his plan to start a game business.

Within four years, Nexters was born and the company grew rapidly, particularly following the launch of its blockbuster title ‚Äî Hero Wars ‚Äî that first brought it international acclaim. However, it was the strategic decision of 2018 to scale on mobile that really powered the firm to the next level. Since then, Nexters has vastly increased its player base, revenue and team to total over 700 professionals, the bulk of them located in Cyprus.

>

GDEV is currently rated as one of the top-3 developers in Europe with¬†**400+ millions**¬†total game installs worldwide with hit games like Hero Wars, Pixel Gun 3D, Island Hopper and others.

[Marketing Growth Figures](https://imgur.com/mv8sJM4)

**What is Hero-Wars?**

The game follows a formula that many mobile gamers will be familiar with: it‚Äôs all about building up a team of heroes and watching them make their way through dungeons. If they‚Äôre not up to the challenge, you have to grind and enhance them, or you have to work to unlock other heroes who might be better suited to the challenge. It‚Äôs a game that‚Äôs really easy to get sucked into, filled with daily challenges that start easy and slowly become more and more difficult as you play and those who play it will soon find that it has become a part of their daily routine.

Throughout the year, Nexters has been actively engaged in its Hero Wars franchise. For example, they have divided Hero Wars into two games ‚Äî the mobile Hero Wars Alliance and the browser-based Hero Wars Dominion Era. Recently they got a collaboration with Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider and have introduced Lara Croft as a character.

The company has released Hero Wars comic books and animated shorts like Rovio did with its Angry Birds franchise. Mobile games outlet Pocket Tactics included Hero Wars Alliance in selection of the best games in 2023 & 2024 and colleagues from PCGames included Hero Wars Dominion Era in selection of the 19 best browser games of the year!

**PIXEL GUN 3D on PC: The new Blockbuster**

[PixelGun3D](https://imgur.com/9sWytbj)

The PC version of Pixel Gun 3D was released on STEAM on April 2nd and it was one of the platform‚Äôs strongest game releases in a while. PG3D broke into the TOP-20 successful new releases on Steam and took first place among the best free-to-play games of April by the total number of players! It recouped all of its development costs within the first day, an unheard feat:¬†

* The game was launched on Steam April 2, entering on debut the Top 20 most sold and Top 50 most played games.
* The mobile version has already accumulated over $200 million in cumulative all-time bookings, while the PC version is just beginning its journey.
* The peak concurrent Steam users count reached 25,000 players on the first day of release.
* The Steam version of Pixel Gun 3D recouped its PC platform development costs within the first day of release, making 5 times the average daily in-app purchases of the mobile version.
* The results were achieved without significant marketing investments, capitalizing on strong brand awareness across the globe.

What is Block City Wars?¬†

It‚Äôs a reboot of the game Block City, originally released in 2016, a GTA-style open-world shooter in minecraft style for mobile platforms. This year, GDEV decided to completely overhaul the game, using all the experience gained from Pixel Gun 3D to turn Block City Wars into a world-class game. Combining a brand new approach to game design with familiar elements that made the original game popular, Block City Wars has made it into the top 10 best Roblox-like games according to PocketGamer!

GDEV continues to fire on all cylinders. Q1 2024 represents the second quarter of impressive bookings growth, the main metric to follow.¬† Lots of people still think that revenue is the most important metric in any business. for online service, the most important is bookings.¬†

For example you purchase an annual Microsoft Office subscription in a midyear. Microsoft includes half of this subscription payment as the revenue for this year and second half for the next year, but as a booking this payment will be reflected as a full cash inflow to the account.

In mobile/online games revenue is based on the distance the player stays in the game, that's why cash inflows or bookings are more relevant to assess the company as it's not tied with time and shows the real figures.

It's important to know that EBITDA is generally designed to show¬† the real profit of a company. By default, high EBITDA margins mean that a business can generate a lot of income from the revenue it makes, but in a free-to-play (F2P) model of the gaming industry there are several interesting nuances.¬†

1. Revenue: If a generous player pays say $1000 in a game today, you cannot recognize this money as revenue immediately, it has to be recognized gradually.¬†
2. Marketing Costs: for gaming companies marketing expenses are not just costs but investments. if a company sees an opportunity to invest more money in marketing today, it ensures revenue streams for long periods ahead, therefore significant marketing expenditures are good.¬†

A quite successful mobile gaming company may see¬† great potential in investing money in marketing, but revenue is recognized gradually while expenses are recognized immediately. As a result EBITDA is in the negative, but the company is in a positive position.

**Total addressable market**

Cantor expects the global video game market revenue growth to reaccelerate in 2025 onwards to mid-single-digit growth, with 2024 being a year of stabilisation as companies focus on restructuring their cost base after years of over-investments. They see 2025 as a stronger year in terms of new large AAA releases including GrandTheftAuto VI and new hardware launches. mobile seems to be nearing a bottom, with market data and quarterly reports from listed companies looking more positive and suggesting that market growth is resuming in 2024 before improving in 2025.

The 2% decline in the mobile games market in 2023 is an improvement from the 5% decline in 2022. encouragingly, the US was flat in 2023 and 65% of the top 20 markets were flat to very modestly up in the year, prepping for a more bullish set-up in 2025.

According to Sensor Tower‚Äôs Q1 2024 Digital Market Index, quarterly mobile game spend surpassed $20 billion for the first time in two years ‚Äî it reached $20.3 billion, up 2.9% year-over-year. Player spending on iOS grew nearly 6% year-over-year to $13 billion, while consumer spend on Google Play slightly declined to $7.3 billion (-1.3%).

"Taking a closer look at the Rivian, Volkswagon partnership","Rivian Automotive (RIVN) and Volkswagen Group (VWAGY) have announced a significant joint venture that includes a substantial investment by Volkswagen in Rivian. This partnership aims to accelerate the development of software and electrical architecture for both companies, combining their strengths to lower costs per vehicle and enhance innovation on a global scale. Rivian's advanced zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform will form the foundation for this collaboration, which will benefit both automakers as they develop new vehicle models in the latter half of the decade.

Volkswagen plans to invest up to $5 billion in Rivian by 2026, starting with an initial $1 billion through an unsecured convertible note that will convert into Rivian‚Äôs common stock under certain conditions. This investment will help alleviate concerns about Rivian's financial stability, particularly given the company's recent losses and workforce reductions. The partnership will enable Volkswagen to leverage Rivian‚Äôs existing electrical architecture and software platform in the short term, while both companies aim to roll out vehicles utilizing the joint technology in the future.

First and foremost, the investment bolsters Rivian's liquidity, providing a lifeline to the startup as it navigates the challenges of scaling up production. The $7.858 billion in cash, augmented by Volkswagen's infusion, transforms the company's financial position, ensuring a solid foundation for the development of its R2 and R3 mass-market SUVs. By addressing short-term concerns, the joint venture paves the way for a more sustainable growth trajectory.The strategic benefits extend beyond capital. Rivian's cutting-edge technology, particularly its zonal hardware design and electrical architecture, becomes a valuable asset for Volkswagen. This integration accelerates both companies' software development, enabling them to create more efficient and cost-effective EV solutions. 

As a result, the partnership fosters a competitive edge, with both entities set to disrupt the mid-to-high-end segment of the market.The deal also implies a shift in market dynamics, as the collaboration signals a shift from standalone competition to a more cooperative model. Smaller EV manufacturers may feel the pressure to either enhance their own technology or explore similar strategic alliances to maintain their relevance. Legacy automakers like Volkswagen, now armed with Rivian's technology, are no longer spectators in the race for electric dominance.However, while the partnership is a game-changer, it's crucial to note that it doesn't guarantee an immediate turnaround for Rivian. The company must still execute effectively on its production optimization and cost structure improvements, as evidenced by the retooling efforts and efficiency initiatives mentioned. The future profitability of both parties will hinge on the successful integration and the ability to deliver on the promises of the joint venture.

Market reaction to the deal has been notably positive for Rivian, with its stock surging up to 50% in after-hours trading. Analysts have hailed the partnership as a game-changer, with Wedbush Securities raising its price target for Rivian's stock and highlighting the significant boost to Rivian's financial health and future prospects. Conversely, Volkswagen's stock saw a slight dip due to concerns over the size of the investment and its struggling software subsidiary Cariad.

   * 70% conversion to FCF: \~$200m
   * Company guidance: $180m (using this to be conservative)
3. Valuation:
   * 20x multiple on FCF (conservative for a high-growth tech company)
   * Projected market cap: $7.8b
   * Projected share price: \~$50 in 2027
4. Growth Rate:
   * Current price: $11.48
   * CAGR to 2027 price target: \~19.51% per year

Why I think it's undervalued:

1. Conservative Guidance - Management seems to be underpromising, which could lead to overdelivering. They've consistently outperformed during earnings as well, and morning during their [investor conference](https://investors.grindr.com/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Grindr-Investor-Day-2024/default.aspx) they increased their revenue guidance for 2024 from revenue growth of at least 23% to at least 25%.
2. Debt Reduction: They should be able to pay down and refinance debt quickly with this cash flow. They've been making good progress here. [https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc\_financials/2023/q1/Grindr-Q1-2023-SHL-vF.pdf](https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Grindr-Q1-2023-SHL-vF.pdf)
3. AI Potential: Their AI investments (like Wingman gen AI bot) aren't factored into guidance but could be huge.
4. Multiple Expansion: A 20x multiple is low for a company growing this fast. Any expansion could lead to significant upside.

Keep in mind: This doesn't even factor in the partnerships & ad revenue. Or the international expansion. These could make the stock worth $100

Risks to consider:

* Execution risk on new products
* Competition??

Tesla Stock Price will go down over the next six months?,"Looking into Tesla, I am predicting that over the next couple of months the price Tesla stock will go down due to multiple factors. I would like to share my thoughts and see what you guys are thinking. 

1. Twitter/X is dead weight: It has been said elsewhere before but it is worth repeating that Elon buying Twitter was a mistake for everyone involved. Twitter was already an unprofitable company well before Elon took over, and his decisions have scarred off a lot of advertisers in having the space be less moderated (not to touch on the issue of how Elon being the face of Tesla has in voicing controversial opinions has made both other companies less willing to work with him as well as tarnished his image to much of the general public). It does not help Elon in any way to keep this website operating.

2. Cybertruck: The resources used to produce the Cybertruck were resources that could have been used to produce EVs that people wanted and were already buying, and or produce a next generation of electric vehicles for the general public. Less than 4,000 Cybertrucks have been sold since April and there have already been 4 recalls for the car.  

3. Tesla is facing increased competition both in places like the US as well as in China, and thus has to start a price war with a country known for selling very cheap goods.

Now. I am not saying that Tesla is doomed or that there will be a massive stock crash. But that in the next months the growth that Tesla will reverse as Tesla faces more competition, more controversy and especially with Twitter acting as an Albatross around Elon‚Äôs neck. What you are seeing now with the price increase over the last month could be some sort of short selling scheme to get people to buy Tesla Stock before it starts to come tumbling down.

The catalysts they are talking about are what I found - they are burning cash for CAPEX, but if they survive until 2026 they can do well.

Tesla isn't the only company that can survive in the space - Rivian demand is growing and they make a great vehicle. They have a strong offering so far, and with enough cash to survive, the R2 will do well and continue further growth into the R3.

Rivian's new partnership and investment with VW was inevitable, though it was uncertain which brand would partner with them. 

We are still low, and this may still be a great time to add some.

Bullish, regards.

"Grindr Hosts First Investor Day. Don't miss out on $GRND, a future 10 bagger","[Investor Day Deck](https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc_presentation/2024/06/Grindr-Investor-Day-6-26-2024.pdf)

Grindr is hosting today in New York its inaugural investor day as a public company, unveiling its plans to deliver on its mission to build the Global Gayborhood in Your Pocket. Presentations by Grindr senior management will highlight its industry-leading performance and user engagement metrics, the Company‚Äôs new product roadmap that is powered by AI, and a four-year financial outlook.

‚ÄúGrindr is unique because it was built by gay people for gay people. By focusing on our users over the past 15 years, we‚Äôve achieved tremendous loyalty and engagement from them,‚Äù said George Arison, Grindr‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer. ‚ÄúThroughout our investor day, we will articulate the innovation we are planning in order to make our user experience even better and drive long-term growth. We are improving connection and casual dating, which have always been core to Grindr, through a suite of features called Right Now, while also creating new AI-first features to help users more easily find long-term relationships. We know our users want additional functionality to help them better access other types of social connections and to access curated, relevant information and services that will enhance the quality of their lives. Through new product expansions, we are creating ways for users to gain these experiences in the app.‚Äù

Grindr will present a multi-year product plan to build out additional functionality in its app. This includes developing eight new products for users to engage with Grindr‚Äôs core use cases of connectivity, dating, and relationships, and Gayborhood expansion use cases, which are new partnership-based digital services typically found in physical gayborhoods. To bring this vision to life, the roadmap leverages AI in a variety of ways, including the Grindr Wingman product.

Today, Grindr is increasing its revenue guidance for 2024 from revenue growth of at least 23% to at least 25%. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024 of at least 40% remains intact. Looking out to 2027, with the Company‚Äôs new product plans designed to support the core dating business, Grindr expects to deliver 20-25% revenue growth annually through 2027, with Adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 39-42%. Grindr‚Äôs expanded, partnership-based, digital Gayborhood services, including travel, wellness, and entertainment experiences, are not reflected in Grindr‚Äôs revenue outlook through 2027, though modest investments in these initiatives are factored into the company‚Äôs long-term Adjusted EBITDA margins.

‚ÄúGrindr has built a durable financial model that is delivering strong, reliable growth as we execute on our monetization strategy,‚Äù said Vanna Krantz, Chief Financial Officer. ‚ÄúOur 2024 revenue guidance increase combined with the longer-term financial targets we are announcing today demonstrate our confidence in Grindr‚Äôs continued strong revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA profitability even as we invest prudently in our product roadmap and new use cases. We believe our plans set up Grindr for significant profitable growth, cash generation and value creation.‚Äù",1719410183.0,investor day deck https investors grindr com files doc_presentation 2024 06 grindr investor day 6 26 2024 pdf grindr hosting today new york inaugural investor day public company unveiling plans deliver mission build global gayborhood pocket presentations grindr senior management highlight industry leading performance user engagement metrics company new product roadmap powered ai four year financial outlook grindr unique built gay people gay people focusing users past 15 years achieved tremendous loyalty engagement said george arison grindr chief executive officer throughout investor day articulate innovation planning order make user experience even better drive long term growth improving connection casual dating always core grindr suite features called right also creating new ai first features help users easily find long term relationships know users want additional functionality help better access types social connections access curated relevant information services enhance quality lives new product expansions creating ways users gain experiences app grindr present multi year product plan build additional functionality app includes developing eight new products users engage grindr core use cases connectivity dating relationships gayborhood expansion use cases new partnership based digital services typically found physical gayborhoods bring vision life roadmap leverages ai variety ways including grindr wingman product today grindr increasing revenue guidance 2024 revenue growth least 23 least 25 adjusted ebitda guidance 2024 least 40 remains intact looking 2027 company new product plans designed support core dating business grindr expects deliver 20 25 revenue growth annually 2027 adjusted ebitda margins range 39 42 grindr expanded partnership based digital gayborhood services including travel wellness entertainment experiences reflected grindr revenue outlook 2027 though modest investments initiatives factored company long term adjusted ebitda margins grindr built durable financial model delivering strong reliable growth execute monetization strategy said vanna krantz chief financial officer 2024 revenue guidance increase combined longer term financial targets announcing today demonstrate confidence grindr continued strong revenue growth adjusted ebitda profitability even invest prudently product roadmap new use cases believe plans set grindr significant profitable growth cash generation value creation,0.9979,2024-06-26

RIVN going to cross $30 within days,"# Rivian Revs Up for Growth with Volkswagen Boost: A Bullish Take on RIVN Stock

Rivian (RIVN) is poised for a surge, with the recent $5 billion investment from Volkswagen acting as a major catalyst. Here's why this could push the stock towards $30 in the near future:

* **Vote of Confidence:** Volkswagen's hefty investment is a resounding endorsement of Rivian's technology and future potential. This validation from a giant automaker significantly boosts Rivian's credibility and market confidence.
* **Cash Flow Lifeline:** The $5 billion provides much-needed capital for Rivian to ramp up production and expand its reach. This financial stability allows Rivian to focus on growth without the immediate pressure of cash burn.
* **Shared Expertise:** The partnership with Volkswagen fosters a powerful knowledge exchange. Rivian gains access to Volkswagen's vast manufacturing experience, while Volkswagen benefits from Rivian's innovative EV technology. This collaboration could accelerate development and innovation for both companies.
* **EV Market Momentum:** The electric vehicle (EV) market continues its strong growth trajectory. With rising gas prices and increasing environmental concerns, consumer demand for EVs remains high. Rivian is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
* **Short-Term Boost:** The initial surge in pre-market trading after the Volkswagen news highlights the market's positive reaction. This momentum could continue in the coming days, pushing the stock price closer to $30.

While predicting the exact stock price is inherently challenging, the Volkswagen partnership injects significant optimism into Rivian's future. With a strong tailwind and strategic collaboration, Rivian's stock price has a compelling case to reach the $30 mark within the near term.

**Important to Consider:**

The stock market is dynamic, and external factors can influence Rivian's performance. Keep an eye on overall market trends, production updates, and any potential challenges Rivian might face.

Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.

Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.

People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings.

**But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**

Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**

Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

"My boring, but relatively successful way to not LOSE money.","This sort of post/story isn‚Äôt new to most people in this sub, but here you go:

Started options trading approximately five years ago. I was watching my Roth, personal brokerage account, and 401k from work slowly go up. I got bored. So fucking bored. That‚Äôs kind of why we are all here, right? That and to get rich or whatever. Anyway.  Ended up blowing a few options accounts (luckily didn‚Äôt touch the 401k or Roth). Made some good money along the way, but not enough. Always wanted MOAR. Still do. 

After seeing my options gains slowly dwindle, and realizing that I was being too impulsive, I slowed down.

If you have a regular job that brings in income and aren‚Äôt relying on trading for your day-to-day expenses, this approach to options might help you to NOT LOSE money. If you‚Äôre looking to get rich quick and you‚Äôre unemployed - probs not for you.  

1. Don‚Äôt put money in your options trading account unless it‚Äôs down to zero. You‚Äôll just end up with less money. There‚Äôs always a play, even with fifty bucks. 
2. Always withdraw when you can, and put it in your savings account. Play with house money. Unless you really want to full-time day trade, you don‚Äôt need that 25k in there. You might make more mistakes (I do, at least) when you feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äúup.‚Äù
3. If you float around the ~5 to 10k amount, only buy one or two options contracts at a time. You‚Äôll miss out on some huge gains, but you‚Äôll not have huge losses. And along the way, in my experience, you can net $500 + a week. It seems so small compared to the gain porn posts on here, but when you withdraw that shit - nah. 
4. When you DO want to make a big play - have all your day trades available. 
5. If you can, pull some of the amounts you transfer from your brokerage to your bank out in CASH. There is something about it that helps you to remember that, yes - it is REAL money. 
6. Don‚Äôt tell anyone about it. 
7. Enjoy the casino with less stress, and more money in day-to-day life. 

Disclaimer: I only follow these rules about 50% of the time. My willpower can‚Äôt fully embrace them, especially if I‚Äôm intoxicated. But they do work.

How are people not more bullish on RDDT?,"Look, I know it's hip to be contrarian and dunk on this platform around here but let's think with the correct head.

Reddit has 1/3 the market cap of Snap and Pinterest. Sure those companies are more mature and have much larger revenues but Reddit is soooo much a better investment. First, Reddit has no competition. Snap or Pinterest can easily get their lunch eaten by Tiktok or whatever next trendy app comes along. Meanwhile even the true regards over at r/RedditAlternatives have thrown in the towel and admit there's no alternative to Reddit. Of course reddit is never gonna compete with Insta or Tiktok due to low quality userbase (yeah I'm talking about you) and a medium less conducive to advertising. But it doesn't matter! Reddit only need to be 1/20th of meta for us to get rich.

Reddit is only gonna keep growing like the chode your wife loves so much. They got Google sending them giga traffic because of all the BS AI articles trying to game the search system. They got OpenAI about to start referencing reddit in their results. They got AI translation for their entire content to other languages for international expansion in testing.

Best part is how bad the current advertising on Reddit is. Some people say this is a negative but it's not, that's what makes this such an opportunity. I've seen how dog water Reddit ads were targeted a few years ago. Now it's merely bad. You're telling me they can't at least make it decent after a while? When communities are already separated by topic?

Half the analysts I see talk about Reddit on TV have no idea what's going on or what the site is other than it's an old school forum that's bad at selling ads. This screams opportunity, 5x is much more likely than 50%.

Nike Increase on earnings ?,"Nike's stock has taken a hit this year due to slower growth, and missed revenue in both Q1 and Q2. While Adidas  Sports and Under Armour might seem like their main rivals, their real rival is not an American company, but Chinese companies flooding the market with knockoffs. These cheap alternatives are extremely popularity for their affordability and amazing quality. You literally can not tell the difference between one of these knockouts and the real things

Recently, Chinese authorities cracked down on major counterfeit operations, including one of the biggest, PandaBuy. They raided warehouses and shut down factories, even arresting the CEO.  Not only was PandaBuy shut down, but others  just as big including one called HagoBuy. I'm assuming this crackdown left consumers scrambling, especially during important events like birthdays and celebrations.

¬†It‚Äôs so popular that I know people who use this site personally and were bummed out when they told me what had happened.¬† Sites were down and people wanted their clothing, birthdays, and celebrations were coming but where would they go?

Nike

Nike is one of the top options for teens/young adults. They have a large market share and correct me if I'm incorrect but they are the biggest by market cap. Nike is the most popular clothing store that has good clothing and is much better priced than their competitors. Their EPS forecast is relatively higher than last quarter, but I have no doubt that they will beat earnings.

There expected revenue is 12.87 Billion, which I think they will likely hit even if my thesis is wrong as they've seemed to just barely hit expectations these past 2 years, and there's no reason for them to miss earnings

This similar rational was used for me going long against Foot locker, which increased 25% in two days despite being much smaller.

Their earnings are on June 27 and I've bought 10% OTM Calls

If I'm right, I really recommend dumping your shares/options, as I'm sure fakes will start flooding the market again and Nike doesn't have what it takes in my opinion to grown exponentially over the years

$ENVX The Next $NVDA?(Metaphorically) A Journey From Jelly to Chips,"$NVDA revolutionized the semi industry and semi architecture again and again with its chip designs. This has improved all tech x1000. But what hasn't changed in 30 years? Your phone lithium ion battery. This is stopping you from being on Reddit all day at work when your phone dies. What's the solution??? ARCHITECTURE. All battery cells for 30 years are a ""jelly roll"" of cathode and anode layers rolled up into a cell. When you try to put silicon in there to expand the battery capacity the silicon swells up and breaks the battery. There are many shitco battery companies that never do anything and give the space a bad name. They are trying to fix this problem with complicated chemistry solutions. Enovix took the cathode/anode and sliced them into square layers and made a stack (like a sandwich) instead of a roll. This is the same way semi chips are made and stacked or so I'm told. They wrap it in a metal case and this structure can withstand and divert the force of any swelling of silicon. This allows >30% more capacity in a cell depending on its size. They have now replaced the whole leadership team with Qualcomm hardcore chip maker production guys and they are getting this damn factory running and shipping by next year. They are fielding sample orders from large megacap tech and phone OEMs. Today an agreement from a AR headset maker that the customer will pay for retooling to make the chips right for the headset. +30% pop today. These announcements are likely to continue IMO.    AI and LLMs and BLTs are all very power hungry to run. Apple already says they want to run AI on device. This needs better batteries.

INTC and AMD,"**Thesis: AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) are Undervalued Stocks**

In the dynamic and highly competitive semiconductor industry, AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) have demonstrated remarkable resilience, innovation, and market presence. Despite their solid fundamentals, both companies appear undervalued when considering their current market prices relative to their intrinsic value, future growth potential, and industry positioning. This thesis will explore the reasons behind this undervaluation, focusing on financial performance, strategic initiatives, market trends, and competitive advantages.

### Financial Performance and Valuation Metrics

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratios:**
   - Both AMD and Intel have P/E ratios that are below the industry average, suggesting that the market has not fully recognized their earnings potential. AMD's forward P/E ratio is around 25, while Intel's is approximately 12, compared to the semiconductor industry average of 30-35.

2. **Revenue and Earnings Growth:**
   - AMD has exhibited robust revenue growth, driven by its strong product portfolio and increasing market share in both consumer and data center segments. The company's revenue grew by over 20% year-over-year in the last few quarters. Intel, despite facing competitive pressures, has maintained stable revenue streams, with significant contributions from its data center and Internet of Things (IoT) segments.

3. **Cash Flow and Profitability:**
   - Both companies generate substantial cash flows, supporting their ability to invest in R&D and return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. AMD's free cash flow margin stands at around 10%, while Intel's is approximately 20%.

### Strategic Initiatives and Technological Advancements

1. **Product Innovation:**
   - AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors have gained significant traction, challenging Intel's dominance in the CPU market. The company's advancements in 7nm and 5nm process technologies have positioned it as a formidable competitor in both consumer and enterprise markets.
   - Intel has made strides in expanding its product lineup, with significant investments in AI, machine learning, and autonomous driving technologies. The introduction of its Alder Lake processors and advancements in 10nm and future 7nm nodes signal a robust product roadmap.

2. **Strategic Acquisitions:**
   - AMD's acquisition of Xilinx is expected to enhance its capabilities in adaptive computing and bolster its presence in key growth markets such as 5G, automotive, and aerospace.
   - Intel's acquisition of Mobileye and investments in autonomous vehicle technology underscore its commitment to diversifying its revenue streams and capitalizing on emerging tech trends.

### Market Trends and Competitive Landscape

1. **Demand for Semiconductors:**
   - The global semiconductor market is projected to grow significantly, driven by increasing demand for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and IoT applications. Both AMD and Intel are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends.

2. **Competitive Positioning:**
   - AMD's competitive pricing and performance advantages have enabled it to gain market share from Intel, particularly in the desktop and server CPU markets. Intel's extensive ecosystem and strong brand equity continue to make it a preferred choice for many enterprise customers.

### Underappreciated Catalysts

1. **Supply Chain Resilience:**
   - Both companies have demonstrated resilience in navigating the global semiconductor supply chain challenges. AMD's partnerships with TSMC and Intel's plans to build new fabs in the US and Europe are strategic moves to mitigate supply risks and ensure capacity for future growth.

2. **Expansion into New Markets:**
   - AMD's foray into gaming consoles with partnerships with Sony and Microsoft, as well as Intel's advancements in the data center, networking, and edge computing, present substantial growth opportunities that are not fully reflected in their current valuations.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, AMD and Intel are undervalued stocks, with market prices that do not fully reflect their intrinsic value, robust financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential for growth in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry. Investors should consider the compelling investment case for both companies, driven by their innovation, competitive positioning, and resilience in the face of industry challenges. As the global demand for semiconductors continues to rise, AMD and Intel are well-equipped to deliver sustained value, making them attractive opportunities for long-term investment.",1719337256.0,thesis amd amd intel intc undervalued stocks dynamic highly competitive semiconductor industry amd amd intel intc demonstrated remarkable resilience innovation market presence despite solid fundamentals companies appear undervalued considering current market prices relative intrinsic value future growth potential industry positioning thesis explore reasons behind undervaluation focusing financial performance strategic initiatives market trends competitive advantages financial performance valuation metrics 1 price earnings p e ratios amd intel p e ratios industry average suggesting market fully recognized earnings potential amd forward p e ratio around 25 intel approximately 12 compared semiconductor industry average 30 35 2 revenue earnings growth amd exhibited robust revenue growth driven strong product portfolio increasing market share consumer data center segments company revenue grew 20 year year last quarters intel despite facing competitive pressures maintained stable revenue streams significant contributions data center internet things iot segments 3 cash flow profitability companies generate substantial cash flows supporting ability invest r return value shareholders dividends buybacks amd free cash flow margin stands around 10 intel approximately 20 strategic initiatives technological advancements 1 product innovation amd ryzen epyc processors gained significant traction challenging intel dominance cpu market company advancements 7nm 5nm process technologies positioned formidable competitor consumer enterprise markets intel made strides expanding product lineup significant investments ai machine learning autonomous driving technologies introduction alder lake processors advancements 10nm future 7nm nodes signal robust product roadmap 2 strategic acquisitions amd acquisition xilinx expected enhance capabilities adaptive computing bolster presence key growth markets 5g automotive aerospace intel acquisition mobileye investments autonomous vehicle technology underscore commitment diversifying revenue streams capitalizing emerging tech trends market trends competitive landscape 1 demand semiconductors global semiconductor market projected grow significantly driven increasing demand high performance computing artificial intelligence iot applications amd intel well positioned capitalize trends 2 competitive positioning amd competitive pricing performance advantages enabled gain market share intel particularly desktop server cpu markets intel extensive ecosystem strong brand equity continue make preferred choice many enterprise customers underappreciated catalysts 1 supply chain resilience companies demonstrated resilience navigating global semiconductor supply chain challenges amd partnerships tsmc intel plans build new fabs us europe strategic moves mitigate supply risks ensure capacity future growth 2 expansion new markets amd foray gaming consoles partnerships sony microsoft well intel advancements data center networking edge computing present substantial growth opportunities fully reflected current valuations conclusion conclusion amd intel undervalued stocks market prices fully reflect intrinsic value robust financial performance strategic initiatives potential growth rapidly evolving semiconductor industry investors consider compelling investment case companies driven innovation competitive positioning resilience face industry challenges global demand semiconductors continues rise amd intel well equipped deliver sustained value making attractive opportunities long term investment,0.9987,2024-06-25

Last call for IMAX -- Time to get your popcorn out!,"IMAX is headed for $23.  And if you already missed the 30% run up in CNK the last 3 weeks, fear not, there is still hope.¬† The summer box office has finally started heating up and I strongly believe IMAX is the next theater stock to benefit from the summer hype cycle.¬† Inside Out 2 is knocking it out of the park ‚Äî having already amassed over $750M in less than 2 weeks.¬† Clearly good movies will put butts in seats ‚Äì especially when record heat waves are giving people another reason to find indoor options for entertainment this summer,¬†

McDonald's $MCD,"# McDonald's: A Top Dividend Growth Play

*  McDonald's has achieved 13 straight quarters of revenue growth, despite high inflation hurting consumer spending.
* The fast-food chain plans aggressive expansion, with a goal of reaching 50,000 global restaurant units by FY 2027.
* McDonald's is a 'Dividend Aristocrat' with consistent profitability and potential for dividend growth.

  
The company continues to see consistent, low-single digit growth in revenues and is aggressively expanding both domestically and internationally. With moderating inflation and a strong unit growth plan for FY 2024 and beyond, McDonald‚Äôs has significant potential for top-line expansion. Additionally, shares trade below the 1-year average price-to-earnings ratio, suggesting a favorable risk profile for long-term investors.

McDonald‚Äôs, a multinational fast-food giant with over 40,000 locations in more than 100 countries and a market cap of $185B, has shown 5% year-over-year revenue growth, achieving $6.2B in the first fiscal quarter. Despite decelerated revenue growth due to inflation, the company still saw a 2% increase in comparable sales in Q1'24, driven by menu price increases, marketing, and customer traffic. The reintroduction of the $5 meal aims to boost foot traffic in U.S. restaurants.

As inflation moderates, increased purchasing power could accelerate McDonald's comparable sales growth. A reversal of the recent downward trend in comparable sales could significantly enhance the investment appeal of McDonald's shares and potentially drive a revaluation of its share price.

The biggest risk for McDonald's is the trajectory of inflation. Persistent inflation in the second half of the year could continue to pressure consumers. To attract more customers, McDonald‚Äôs, in cooperation with its franchisees, has reintroduced its $5 value meal. However, a resurgence of inflation in the third and fourth quarters could pose a significant risk to the company's comparable revenue growth.

Grindr's (GRND) investor day tomorrow could introduce some new catalysts,"Alright degenerates,

Been balls deep in GRND research lately, and I'm starting to think we're sleeping on a rainbow gold mine here.

Grindr's investor day is tomorrow, and these guys are talking about building a wholeass ""global gayborhood"" in your pocket. We're not just talking dick pics and ""I'm horny"" messages here - this could be the Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp for the LGBTQIA++. Most recently they're expanding into travel because apparently gays travel a lot.

George Arison is a Gigachad baller CEO. I watched his interviews. He's a human catalyst for getting shit done.

[gay bear CEO](https://preview.redd.it/7gn0yj5qkq8d1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=82463c096e386577fe0ec126d9a0e2a59199ae03)

He's been teasing AI and machine learning shit they've been testing, which sounds like it could print money if they get it right. We all know gays love to roleplay and pretend, so lots of potential in this Gay-AI. Even if their AI-wingman feature is just some horny twink bot, it's a revenue stream waiting to happen...

Another thing is that they're only monetizing 7% of their users right now. SEVEN PERCENT. That's like leaving money on the table. They recently tried changing their pricing model to offer weekly subs and bam... 16% increase in revenue per paying user. Just like that. üíÖ The CFO also said earlier this month that AB testing revealed prices are more inelastic than expected in the US, so they can clearly still increase revenue by optimizing their pricing.

Now I'm not saying GRND is gonna Uranus üçë overnight. But consider this: Match Group is trading at 5x Grindr, but Grindr's extending far beyond dating, their users are spending 2x the time on the app, gays are statistically richer and hornier, and tap water is turning everyone gay these days.

I was looking for ideas on how to capitalize on this.

$ZI Buyout or News Catalyst Incoming? Unusual Activity.,"Very unusual options activity for August, Stanley Druckenmiller and a few other top fund managers heavily increasing their positions. Company is FCF positive, currently running a share buyback, smells like a buyout.

Firstly, $ZI attracted a little retail attention when Stanley Druckenmiller bought in (If you don't know who he is look him up).¬†¬†After substantially decreasing his position in $NVDA his largest % increase was in $ZI. Bare in mind he was one of the first into NVDA and to actively inform the public why he thought it was such a good bet.

His most recent 13f shows that he increased his position by 500% and has an average share price of $17. Earnings were then released and the stock tanked, pretty common in current conditions for a software name.

He wasn‚Äôt alone in his aggressive purchase, infact, the below super investors also increased their positions:

**David Shaw**¬†¬†by 266%

**Israel Englander** by 129%

**Joel Greenblatt** by 407%

¬†All of which have solid track records, feel free to investigate them yourself.

¬†**But this is when it gets very interesting‚Ä¶**

On the 15^(th)¬†May the open interest across most strikes was low, almost no activity, especially the August strikes. Yet that all changed at a very rapid pace.

¬†15^(th)¬†May the open interest for the $15 August strike was just a single contract.

¬†16^(th)¬†May this jumped up too 19,315 in practically a single block

Fast forward to the 11^(th)¬†July and it jumps up to 39,380

¬†That‚Äôs just for the $15 strike..

¬†The $16 strike had 171 open interest on Monday last week, today it's 20,700 and again looks to be  a single buyer. With just a few small orders copying the buy.

Now $14 is getting scooped in large quantities and the $13.

Leaving the following for 53 days out:

13 strike - 10,221 OI (1,000% increase in 10 days)

14 strike - 15,362 (500% increase in 10 days)

15 strike - From 1 to 41,033 in 30 days

19 strike - From 0 to 37,136 in 30 days

The rest of the chains have very

To me this indicates that somebody is obviously aware of a catalyst that's due to happen before that date, otherwise you‚Äôre likely to go further out (longer dates) or closer to in the money when putting on such size. My best bet would be a buyout target of $18-$19 based on the strikes chosen. Like I say, this is a calculated guess. Had this play been made for much further out contracts I‚Äôd be less suspicious. However, buying 70,000+ contracts for <60 days out clustered around the same strike is a huge green flag.

Now they're hitting the shorter dated too, July's, check todays flow so far. It's getting completely absurd at this point and to me it looks like block orders (a small group of buyers).

As the saying goes, somebody always knows.

What gives me more confidence is the company continues to outperform, has a healthy balance sheet and produces more and more free cash flow each year.

**Free Cash Flow:**

2023 $408

2022 $388m

2021 $275m

2020 $152m

2019 $30m

Cash on hand: $400m¬†

Current Share Buyback plan still operating.

The company is founder-led by Henry Schuck, rather than me regurgitate a load of information you can view the companies latest results here.

32.57% of the float is held by insiders with very tiny activity this year. If they were concerned about the companies share price being a real reflection of the business, I‚Äôd expect to see some of that enormous interest exiting. Given the latest numbers, I‚Äôm not surprised they remain bullish.

So what I‚Äôll be doing is simple, positioning with some short dated calls accompanied by shares. I've gone for shorter dated because I'll buy again in 30 days If the buyout doesn‚Äôt happen.

3. The 5B share buyback plan is only halfway completed. This meaning that FedEx still has $2.5B to buy back

4. FedEx is implementing a new wave of AI cameras in the contractor trucks. Everyone knows that AI is bullish.

5. FedEx has closed many stations over the last year, with many more likely to come. These closures included layoffs. Both of these are bullish

The negatives

1. The loss of the USPS contract will decrease yearly revenue by $2B. However the contract was not that profitable and FedEx will be able to reduce expenditures on the extra mail flights that will be eliminated

Reddit is so bearish on Tesla and Boeing‚Ä¶ I think we know what this means,"I just came across subs hating on Musk: r/cyberstuck, r/musked, and r/realtesla. Are you joking? The Musk hate boner is at an all time high. Even Meta, when it crashed to $90, didn‚Äôt receive these levels of hate. This has me wondering‚Ä¶ is it time for me to ape my entire margin account into Tesla?

In addition to Tesla, the Boeing hate has been rampant. Do you guys realize that at any one moment, thousands of Boeing aircraft are flying in the air? Flying a Boeing across the globe is safer than driving to your local Wendy‚Äôs. Yes, the company has glaring issues and I am not discounting the several hundred people who died due to the company‚Äôs negligence. But are we forgetting that Boeing operates in a duopoly with $500B in backlog? Do you really think this company is so regarded they won‚Äôt be able to turn it around? At one point, Boeing had a stellar safety record and was the crown jewel for America. I believe now that they‚Äôre getting anally pummeled by everyone and their mom, they will fix things.

People citing GM and Citi Bank as behemoths that failed are absolute morons. Y‚Äôall realize that Boeing sales aren‚Äôt falling the way they did with GM, right?

Anyways, this isn‚Äôt financial advice. I‚Äôm just pointing out the two most hated companies on Reddit. You know what to do‚Ä¶.

Money rotation by the funds,"After briefly becoming #1 by market cap, Nvidia has shed the tag and has dropped by few percentage points every session since 20th June. 

Rationale:

1) Bearish engulfing pattern: but bearish engulfing pattern has occured few times [latest being on 10th March, 2024] and the stock has rebounded strongly to scale new ATH
2) PE stretch in AI/Tech : PE multiples of Nvidia and related tech co [Broadcom, SMCI, Micron etc] have expanded sharply and there are concerns if revenue and profits can keep pace. But this may be revealed in next earnings cycle only.
3) General exhaustion with tech/AI: investors are taking profit and looking to invest in different opportunities. The fact that DOW rose and S&P remained steady [since 20th June] means the money still remains in the market.
4) Pull backs are healthy: it allows market/investors to reassess  the stock. Short term traders exit while provides attractive entry points for long term investors.

*I had pointed in one of my previous posts to shed concentration in AI/tech and to seek different opportunities.

Funds have been reported to rotate money out of tech/AI into energy, [surprisingly] bank, and other defensive stocks.

Crypto, cryto ETF, and crypto related stocks have tumbled because of  no rate cut expectations for Q3, '24.

I believe Gold may stay range bound or face a mild correction in weeks to come.

Meme stocks seem to have lost steam as investors attention shift to other opportunities.

What to do? 

Nvidia [now at pre split level price] and others now are attractively priced compared to previous week. This correction presents an attractive opportunity for long term investors.

Keep AI/Tech concentration < 50%

Seek different opportunities and even defensive stocks [Berkshire, Walmart, Mondelez, General Mills, Chubb, 3M etc]

NVDA YOLO Update - Still an Easy Hold - Do you Regards Ever Zoom Out?,"So I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dl1jco/nvda_easy_hold_yolo_update_140k/) post after last week's dip about holding NVDA leaps after \~30k intra-day drop on Thursday from $172k to $140k.

I knew the gheys would be out and about in full force especially after today.  Sure enough, I get out of work and see there already are some unhinged DMs/comments waiting, or asking for an update.

I sold none of them, and in fact added a couple more Nov '24 leaps during lunch today.

I've already made \~10 posts at this point over various NVDA news/announcements in the past quarter, along with DD posts on the progression of this YOLO that started from \~$38k, went to as high as $172k and is now down to $105k.

I'm not repeating all that again, or listing more objective reasons simply because there's been no fundamental reason driving this sell-off other than:

a) profit-taking

b) quarterly-end rebalancing

c) sell the news factor after NVDA briefly toppled MSFT

All I'm gonna say is - Blackwell revenues for this year are going to be nuts, and it'll become clear in the next earnings call. If there ever was a time to load up on the dip (and I mean either leaps, or shares -- not regarded weeklies), it'd be now.

One of the worst seven day periods of the year.  ,"I always check the calendar before making a trading decision.  Save this one below and a few other tables I recently posted for future reference.  You cannot use the information in isolation but in combination with other data, this stuff can be very useful for making short-term trade decisions.  I am currently up almost 575K since going YOLO in my options account on short-term QQQ and big 7 PUTS since last Thursday, June 20th - you were warned.  Despite still thinking that QQQ gap at 469 will close, I am now down to just 30% of my PUTS position now since it's no use being too greedy.  I still want that cool mill on the trade, so I am not closing just yet, but I have my trailing stops now in place to protect, hedges and all house money now and more.  Good luck to all.

FedEx DD ahead of ER. (To the moon) ,"Here we go! 
FedEx is facing challenges just like every quarter, weaker demand, etc, despite these hurdles, FedEx has been focusing on cost-cutting measures to improve its bottom-line performance.

What they have done to improve these challenges? 

Cost-Cutting Measures:

1. DRIVE Program: FedEx launched the DRIVE program, a comprehensive cost-cutting and efficiency-improving initiative. This program aims to streamline operations across its transportation segments, lower overhead costs, and enhance digital capabilities. These efforts are expected to result in significant long-term savings and improved profitability. 

2. Operational Efficiencies: FedEx has focused on improving operational efficiencies within its various units, particularly in FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. By optimizing routes, reducing unnecessary expenses, and leveraging technology, FedEx aims to enhance service levels while cutting costs.

Strategic Adjustments

1. Volume Management: Despite a weaker demand environment, FedEx has been actively managing its volume levels to match capacity more effectively. This includes adjusting flight schedules hedules and reducing underutilized assets to better align with current demand trends.

2. Rate Increases: To offset some of the financial pressures from declining volumes, FedEx has implemented rate increases for its services. This helps to maintain revenue levels even as shipment volumes fluctuate. 

FedEx and artificial intelligence‚Ä¶ 

FedEx has indeed been integrating artificial intelligence (Al) into its operations to improve efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and streamline logistics processes. Here are some key areas where FedEx is utilizing Al:
Predictive Analytics and Automation

1. Routing and Logistics: FedEx uses Al to optimize routing and logistics. By analyzing large datasets, Al helps FedEx predict the most efficient delivery routes, reducing transit times and fuel consumption. This improves overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.

2. Package Sorting: Al and machine learning algorithms are employed in FedEx's sorting facilities to automate the process of package sorting. This enhances accuracy and speeds up the handling of parcels, particularly during peak seasons .

Thesis: The Reflection of Stock Market Patterns in Everyday Objects: A Study of Fractal and Chaotic Similarities,"# Abstract

This thesis explores the intriguing observation that patterns typically seen in stock market charts can also be identified in everyday objects, such as the torn edge of a piece of cardboard. By examining the principles of fractals, chaos theory, and human psychology, this study aims to highlight the pervasive nature of self-similar patterns across different contexts. Understanding these connections not only enhances our appreciation of natural and financial systems but also offers insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive complex patterns in diverse environments.

# Introduction

Patterns are a fundamental aspect of both natural and human-made systems. In financial markets, technical analysts use chart patterns to predict future price movements. Interestingly, similar patterns can often be seen in nature and everyday objects, suggesting a deeper connection. This thesis investigates the hypothesis that stock market patterns can be observed in the physical world around us, using a torn piece of cardboard as a primary example.

# Literature Review

1. **Fractals in Nature and Markets**
   * Fractals are structures that exhibit self-similarity, meaning their patterns repeat at different scales. They are ubiquitous in nature, appearing in forms such as coastlines, mountain ranges, snowflakes, and plant structures (Mandelbrot, 1982).
   * In financial markets, fractals are evident in price movements on different time scales, where short-term fluctuations mirror long-term trends (Peters, 1994).
2. **Chaos Theory and Market Dynamics**
   * Chaos theory explains how complex systems can exhibit both random and deterministic behavior. This theory has been applied to various fields, including meteorology, biology, and economics (Gleick, 1987).
   * In the context of financial markets, chaos theory suggests that small changes in market conditions can lead to significant and seemingly unpredictable price movements, yet these movements often follow underlying patterns (Mandelbrot & Hudson, 2004).
3. **Psychological Patterns**
   * Human psychology plays a critical role in both market behavior and everyday actions. Behavioral finance studies how psychological factors influence investors' decisions, leading to predictable patterns in market movements (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
   * Similar psychological principles can influence mundane actions, such as tearing a piece of cardboard, resulting in patterns that mirror market trends.

# Methodology

To explore the hypothesis, this study uses a qualitative analysis of a torn piece of cardboard and compares its pattern to typical stock market charts. The analysis focuses on identifying common patterns such as downtrends, uptrends, breaks, and retests.

# Results

1. **Visual Comparison**
   * A torn edge of cardboard exhibits jagged, irregular lines that often slope downward initially, then shift upward. This resembles a market downtrend followed by an uptrend, with small corrections and retests.
   * In stock market charts, a downtrend (series of lower highs and lower lows) can be followed by a reversal into an uptrend (series of higher highs and higher lows).
2. **Breaks and Retests**
   * The cardboard tear shows points where the tear line changes direction or has small breaks, similar to market corrections or consolidations.
   * On the stock chart, these breaks and retests represent areas where the price tests previous support or resistance levels before continuing in the trend direction.

# Discussion

The similarities between the torn cardboard edge and stock market charts can be explained by the principles of fractals and chaos theory. Both systems exhibit self-similarity and follow underlying deterministic rules that create complex, yet patterned outcomes. Additionally, human psychology influences both market behaviors and everyday actions, leading to the formation of similar patterns in different contexts.

# Conclusion

This study demonstrates that patterns typically seen in stock market charts can also be observed in everyday objects like a torn piece of cardboard. The presence of fractal and self-similar patterns across different domains highlights the interconnectedness of natural and financial systems. Understanding these connections offers valuable insights into the mechanisms driving complex patterns, enhancing our ability to predict and interpret both market behaviors and natural phenomena.

Why not?,"Hi all experienced investors,

I've been investing for many years, and I'm partially successful at it. I'm in no way an expert or even close.

One thing I've been looking at more recently is setting up orders to buy shares when it hits a certain price, or sell them if it drops below a certain price (stop loss, etc).

One question I have is, why do people not just look for a share that has the possibility of doing well. Buy in to it, say at $100/share (for example), assuming it improves to say, $106, set up a sell order if goes below $105.  And it it does sell, just set up a buy order if it goes above ‚Ç¨105 again.

If doesn't drop/sell, and just keeps going up, increase the sell order value to a certain percentage below the value, to ensure the loss is minimal.

So basically, if it drops SELL, and buy back in if it increases above that sell price. Surely, this would be a safeguard against a share dropping value (as it would automatically sell before any major loss).

Why SAVE might save your Portfolio ,"Current Valuation and Past Bidding WarCurrent Valuation: 

Spirit Airlines is currently valued at $424 million.

Past Bidding War: Two years ago, Frontier Airlines and JetBlue were in a bidding war for Spirit Airlines, offering $2.65 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. 
This indicates that major industry players valued Spirit much higher than its current market cap.

Market Conditions and Industry TrendsTravel Activity Surge:
 
Travel activity has soared as the world emerges from the pandemic. Leisure travel demand is at an all-time high, and Spirit, being an ultra-low-cost carrier, is well-positioned to benefit from this surge.

Recovery in Business Travel: 

Business travel, which was severely impacted by the pandemic, is also recovering. Spirit Airlines can capture a portion of this market, further boosting its revenues.

Strategic Value and Government Considerations

Strategic Importance: Spirit Airlines has a significant market share in the ultra-low-cost carrier segment. Both Frontier and JetBlue saw strategic value in acquiring Spirit to expand their market reach and competitive positioning.

Government Intervention:
 
The U.S. government blocked the JetBlue deal due to antitrust concerns. However, allowing Spirit to go bankrupt would reduce competition and hurt consumers by limiting low-cost travel options. The government has a vested interest in maintaining a competitive landscape in the airline industry.

Financial Metrics and Potential Revenue Growth Potential:
 
With the increase in travel demand, Spirit Airlines can see substantial revenue growth. Pre-pandemic, Spirit's annual revenue was around $3.8 billion. 
With current travel trends, it‚Äôs reasonable to expect revenues to surpass pre-pandemic levels.

Cost Efficiency: 

Spirit's ultra-low-cost model allows it to operate with higher margins compared to traditional airlines. This cost efficiency can lead to higher profitability as revenues grow.

Market Comparisons and Valuation
 
Looking at the valuations during the bidding war, Spirit was valued between $2.65 billion to $3.7 billion.
 Given the current travel boom, a conservative estimate places Spirit's potential value at least in the middle of this range, if not higher.

Multiples Expansion:

 If Spirit can achieve $4 billion in annual revenue and maintain a net profit margin of 10% (industry average for low-cost carriers), it would generate $400 million in net profit.
 
With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10x (low end for the industry), Spirit could be valued at $4 billion, nearly 10x its current market cap.

Conclusion

Given the strategic value, increased travel demand, financial growth potential, and the government's interest in maintaining competition, Spirit Airlines is significantly undervalued at $424 million. The past bidding war highlights its intrinsic value, and with favorable market conditions, it is reasonable to expect the stock to 7-10x from its current valuation.",1719082499.0,current valuation past bidding warcurrent valuation spirit airlines currently valued 424 million past bidding war two years ago frontier airlines jetblue bidding war spirit airlines offering 2 65 billion 3 7 billion respectively indicates major industry players valued spirit much higher current market cap market conditions industry trendstravel activity surge travel activity soared world emerges pandemic leisure travel demand time high spirit ultra low cost carrier well positioned benefit surge recovery business travel business travel severely impacted pandemic also recovering spirit airlines capture portion market boosting revenues strategic value government considerations strategic importance spirit airlines significant market share ultra low cost carrier segment frontier jetblue saw strategic value acquiring spirit expand market reach competitive positioning government intervention u government blocked jetblue deal due antitrust concerns however allowing spirit go bankrupt would reduce competition hurt consumers limiting low cost travel options government vested interest maintaining competitive landscape airline industry financial metrics potential revenue growth potential increase travel demand spirit airlines see substantial revenue growth pre pandemic spirit annual revenue around 3 8 billion current travel trends reasonable expect revenues surpass pre pandemic levels cost efficiency spirit ultra low cost model allows operate higher margins compared traditional airlines cost efficiency lead higher profitability revenues grow market comparisons valuation looking valuations bidding war spirit valued 2 65 billion 3 7 billion given current travel boom conservative estimate places spirit potential value least middle range higher multiples expansion spirit achieve 4 billion annual revenue maintain net profit margin 10 industry average low cost carriers would generate 400 million net profit price earnings p e ratio 10x low end industry spirit could valued 4 billion nearly 10x current market cap conclusion given strategic value increased travel demand financial growth potential government interest maintaining competition spirit airlines significantly undervalued 424 million past bidding war highlights intrinsic value favorable market conditions reasonable expect stock 7 10x current valuation,0.9932,2024-06-22

"VIX based FXAIX investment strategy, what am I doing wrong?","So I just excel'd a very basic hypothetical investment strategy based on these rules:

- VIX < 20 : buy ~~FXAIX~~ VOO
- 20 < VIX < 30 : sell ~~FXAIX~~ VOO
- 30 < VIX < 50 : buy ~~FXAIX~~ VOO and ride it whatever direction until VIX < 20
- 50 < VIX : sell ~~FXAIX~~ VOO and wait until VIX < 50, then buy and ride down until VIX < 20

If these rules were followed since November 1, 2019 the performance would look like this: https://imgur.com/5XXjJie

It doesnt avoid every downturn but it avoids enough to vastly outperform the market.

I'm obviously an idiot and there are no free money glitches. What did I do wrong?

Shorting NVDA,"1) most companies are not vertically GPU-bounded anymore, adding more GPU doesn‚Äôt really solve anything. For horizontal scaling we are bounded by experts who know how to use the GPU
2) reality check; there is no way that world will stop running if we take GPUs away right now. How about if we take Office365 away? Can NVDA really be most expensive company in the world? No
3) NVDA is not alone, Google‚Äôs TPU chips provide nice acceleration for linear algebra and so do AMD. Broadcom is building those TPUs
4) CUDA is very powerful framework but for AI you need powerful matmul. XLA and ROCm work fine for training and they are catching up.

"Let's Dicuss: Foreign Investment, the witching hour, and July expectations","A question: how much of the shares on the united states stock exchanges are held by foreign investment? I'm new at diving deep into technicals and i want a good source for these analytics. I'd imagine being able to track something like increasing foreign capital into the markets would be a very useful indicator for numerous reasons.

A big event this week: all of us new regards discovering massive waves of expiring options have drastic impacts on volatile stocks like NVDA. The events leading up to the witching hour were insane levels of volaility and liquidation. How would a smart person play an event like this and what are IV levels usually like before and after?

Looking into July: So many tech stock earnings coming into July along with some economic data this coming week (June 24-28) that I think will be positive. core PCE will grow confidence in the FED to cut interest rates. If big tech stocks beat earnings expectations we could have a huge month for tech and see QQQ and SPY continue to set ATHs. I don't see too many bearish indictors but what would be a propable cause for a poor July? We are in a period of crazy growth YTD but who is to say that it cannot continue on? the tech markets look good and we have seen in the 2020-2021 era that long periods of growth can and do happen.

Why F (Ford) Stock is in my Portfolio and Where I See Potential Growth,"I've been holding F stock over the last few years and despite a lot of negative sentiment I see about this stock, I feel that it's value is under recognized as a key player in the automotive space.

**Why Do I Like F?**

1. The biggest reason I am interested in Ford is FORD PRO. For those who do not know, Ford Pro is their commercial sales and software business.  Think of it as a fleet management software company working inside of Ford, coupled with auto sales, financing, vehicle servicing, and telematics. It helps commercial Ford customers like construction or delivery companies manage the upkeep and tracking of their entire commercial vehicle fleet, ensuring that the vehicles are serviced, being fuel/energy efficient, and optimized.
2. [The USPS recently announced their purchase of over 9,000 E-transit vans](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/04/24/first-quarter-2024-financial-results.html), and [Ecolab expanded their electric fleet with Ford as well.](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/01/30/ecolab-accelerates-north-american-fleet-electrification-with-for.html)
3. **Ford PRO alone saw revenues of $18 Billion in Q1 of 2024, which is up 36% YOY with a nearly 17% EBIT margin at $3B**.
4. Despite the huge growth in **Ford PRO revenue, F's total market cap is only $47.27B. Part of my investment thesis for F stock is that Ford PRO could eventually be a $30-$40B business on its own.**
5. **Ford's EV segment lost money in Q1 ($1.3 billion)due to costs and slowing demand, so I believe they will scale back a bit while still being a player.** In the US, they are second only to TSLA when it comes to EV sales and it's important that they continue to be number two.
6. **Their Ford Blue segment, or non-commercial ICE and Hybrid segment had slightly lower revenues due to production slow downs but still had $21B in revenue with a EBIT of $900M.**
7. Ford has the diversification of ICE, Hybrid, and EV models which continues to be a differentiator. In May 2024, Ford saw an increase of 64.7% YOY in EV sales, and a 64.5% YOY increase in hybrid sales. 
8. [**Full Year 2024, Ford is tracking to do $10-12B EBIT guidance range.**](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/04/24/first-quarter-2024-financial-results.html)
9. As interest rates decrease, which most economists predict they will in the latter half of 2024, auto sales should see a bit less pressure.

When compared to TSLA with a market cap of $573.46B and a P/E ratio of 46, I find that F is an incredibly good value at a market cap of just $47.27B and a P/E ratio of 12.

It's notable that Ford's Q1 net income was actually higher than Tesla's at $1.13B for TSLA and $1.3B for Ford.

This makes me feel even more confident that Ford is underestimated.

**LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST:**

F pays an annual dividend of $0.60 per share, which at the current price of $11.84, this presents an attractive yield of 5.07%.

Given all the growth, diversity in the business, and huge potential of the Ford PRO segment - this stock is undervalued and I think it's a good buy going into their earnings which will be announced next month on July 24, 2024.

Time to invest in Unity? Recent struggles might be a golden opportunity,"Hear me out, I know Unity has had its fair share of controversies and missteps lately. The pricing changes and leadership issues have definitely shaken investor confidence. BUT, I think this could be a fantastic buying opportunity for those with a long-term perspective.

Here's why:

Market Dominance: Unity is still the leading platform for game development, especially in the indie and mobile space. Their engine is powerful, versatile, and has a massive user base.
VR/AR Growth: Unity is incredibly well-positioned to benefit from the growing VR and AR markets. Their engine is already the go-to choice for many developers in this space.
Metaverse Potential: If the metaverse ever becomes a reality, Unity will be a major player. Their tools are perfect for building immersive 3D worlds and experiences.
Recent Dip: The recent price drop has made Unity shares more affordable than they've been in a while. This could be a good entry point for those willing to weather the short-term storm.
Of course, there are risks:

Competition: Unreal Engine is a strong competitor, and other engines are emerging. Unity needs to keep innovating to stay ahead.
Leadership: The company needs to address its leadership issues and regain the trust of developers and investors.
Market Volatility: The tech sector is notoriously volatile. There's no guarantee that Unity's stock will rebound.
My Take:

I believe in Unity's long-term potential. They have a strong product, a huge market opportunity, and a passionate community. If they can overcome their current challenges, I think they could be a big winner in the years to come.

Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, this is just my opinion. Do your own research before investing in any stock.

What do you think? Is this a good time to invest in Unity? Let me know in the comments!

* Let‚Äôs start at the rack level. A typical front end rack with CPUs has about 32 fibers that come into the the top of the rack rack. 16 ports 2 fibers per port.
* Assuming one of these backend networks, GPU racks will tend to have a couple of NVDA H100 servers to service those you need more like 256 fibers on that same rack.

"$PENN No, no. They should not sell‚Ä¶","I‚Äôve said it for months, but PENN is a sleeper. It‚Äôs funny that it took a few ‚Äúhe said she said‚Äù acquisition rumors for people to realize how undervalued this business is, but I‚Äôd argue the value is NOT in selling. 

Buyers buy things that add more value than what they pay. At least smart ones do‚Ä¶ Boyd gaming would only be interested in (potentially) paying billions of dollars if they see something of value exceeding their price. In other words, Boyd thinks PENN is worth more than its current market value (as the only way a sale would be approved is if it exceeded the current cap with enough of a return to justify to shareholders). 

Sellers sell when they think the offer is more than the company is worth or can reasonably be worth in a defined amount of time. So why should PENN not sell? Because for a few quarters they‚Äôve been trying to tell the market that they‚Äôre undervalued and finally a few analysts, activist investors, and now even competitors are agreeing.  

My deeper analysis on their ESPN Fantasy Football integration potential, casino valuation, etc can be found in my past posts. I absolutely think CEO Jay Snowden is over compensated considering recent performance, but this plan is bigger than him staying as CEO (this plan will succeed regardless if he is CEO or not, imo). The most material change of recent is that some of their state data for April and May are showing lower promo spend and higher gross revenue, even on seasonally lower handles. This is great news and should be tracked further if you‚Äôre here for a deep value play like me.

NFE - Near term positive catalyst next week as Altamira LNG site goes live,"Shares are down slightly over the last week as investors await the next PR announcing the completion of the long awaited (and repeatedly delayed) Altamira, MX offshore LNG export facility. Should get that news early next week. NFE's Penguin LNG vessel is already moored awaiting to load the first cargo. That'll likely generate yet another PR from the company and should push the stock upwards to begin retracing the huge FUD fueled discount over the last 6 weeks that sent the stock from $29.11 to $20.79 multi year low. $21.56 currently. Shorts have covered around 800k-1m shares over the last week but still are short 14m. Any mediocre sized bids (5k+) scares supply and the MM algos away immediately, even when submitted $0.05-0.10 below the current bid. Once this stock starts to squeeze it tends to squeeze hard. 

32k open interest for 8/16 calls from $22-35 strike so the gamma squeeze potential here is also compelling. Valuation is ridiculously cheap versus management's 2024 $6 FFO guide + 2025's very likely $6-7 FFO as well. Mgmt has previously discussed buyback plans with the stock above $30 so that's another near term catalyst as well. Long term NFE should eventually trade far closer in-line with LNG's (the stock, Cheniere Energy) multiples. LNG sits at 14x Forward E vs 6x FE for NFE here. $50+ implied share price for NFE once investors rerate the stock for the steady/predictable cash flows it'll generate for years to come from their import/export LNG ports as well as nat gas power plants in Brazil.",1718992504.0,shares slightly last week investors await next pr announcing completion long awaited repeatedly delayed altamira mx offshore lng export facility get news early next week nfe penguin lng vessel already moored awaiting load first cargo likely generate yet another pr company push stock upwards begin retracing huge fud fueled discount last 6 weeks sent stock 29 11 20 79 multi year low 21 56 currently shorts covered around 800k 1m shares last week still short 14m mediocre sized bids 5k scares supply mm algos away immediately even submitted 0 05 0 10 current bid stock starts squeeze tends squeeze hard 32k open interest 8 16 calls 22 35 strike gamma squeeze potential also compelling valuation ridiculously cheap versus management 2024 6 ffo guide 2025 likely 6 7 ffo well mgmt previously discussed buyback plans stock 30 another near term catalyst well long term nfe eventually trade far closer line lng stock cheniere energy multiples lng sits 14x forward e vs 6x fe nfe 50 implied share price nfe investors rerate stock steady predictable cash flows generate years come import export lng ports well nat gas power plants brazil,0.8271,2024-06-21

Will TMF 5x?,"Bonds are at an historical low. I am looking at the 3x leveraged bonds for greater returns, risk also considered. 
From what I‚Äôve read, there are 3 conditions for TMF to skyrocket: 
1. Inflation needs to go to 2%. This is the first and most important condition. This will trigger the next conditions. When inflation reaches this point, the FED will consider cutting down interest rates. At this moment, interest rates are currently well above 5%. If rates drop 1%, the 10 year bonds will rise 10%, 20 year bonds 20% and so on. Of course this is an estimation. Moving on to the next condition:
2. Interest rates need to go lower, like way lower. But just because inflation is at 2% or lower, it doesn‚Äôt mean 100% that the FED will cut interest rates. This takes us to the next condition: 
3. Slow economic growth. To stimulate economic growth, low interest rates are necessary.

If all 3 conditions are met, I believe TMF could bring huge returns. When? Maybe a few years, maybe sooner, this one is to be seen.
I am slowly building a large position on TMF, I am curious what others think about this

Ulta Beauty Stock -- Overlooked Opportunity,"Ulta Beauty is a specialty retailer that sells beauty & beauty adjacent products. They have physical stores as well as ""stores within stores"" at place like Target & such. 

***Market Context:***

- Ulta has dominant position in basically oligopoly with Colgate, PG, Sephora, and Elf

- beauty industry has been rising for years, beauty products demand premium & remain inelastic even in times of economic burden

- trading at low valuation of under 15 p/e 

***The Business:***

- strong loyalty program (95% of all sales are from loyalty rewards members)

- 40 million loyalty members (more members than mcdonalds that has 40k stores vs. ulta w/ 1000-1500)

- estimated growth at 9%-12%, gross margins at 42%, return on invested capital at 26%

- consistent share buybacks, strong free cash flow 

- same store sales growth at 8%-12% a year

- consistently beat earnings & EPS estimates (q1 beat in spite of lower guidance)

***Bears Say:***

- beauty retailers will gradually lose market share to online conglomerates like Amazon

- growth potential is stagnating as business matures

- beauty products are extremely elastic to market conditions 

***Why Bears Are Wrong:***

- exclusive releases & partnerships w/ celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Rihanna, etc. has continued to drive demand for in store visits 

- women want to physically see and often test the products for themselves at specialty retailers to see large selection of what is available 

- store experience is enjoyable for women, which drives further loyalty

- makeup is not elastic (women want to look pretty, always & willing to spend for desired results)

- Ulta still has runway to open more stores in US or even expand internationally w/ their scale

- Ulta can unlock synergies within adjacent segments in beauty like Salons and such (which they have been pursuing)

- consumer shifts in animal cruelty free makeup & organics lead to a trend of charging higher premiums on select products

***Price Targets:***

- $486 average from what I have seen (high $608) vs. current price of $380. Shares were $500+ earlier in year. upside potential of 25-45% depending on what targets you are looking at 

***Conclusion:***

- Ulta is undervalued by a wide margin, in spite of the stock losing a lot of value over the past couple of months, the business fundamentals remain unchanged & perhaps even more optimistic than initial guidance at the time. Ulta will continue to enjoy its dominant position in the wider market, and the business is growing & has many more growth vectors to still explore, whether it be international expansion or other business segments. Wide economic moat driven by loyal and devout consumer base. Even if they didn't grow at all, same store sales growth is really strong, which would result in organic growth.

Finding Mispriced Call Options,"Yesterday I posted about Tegna (TGNA ), with its high short-interest, and the ungodly amount of share buybacks that the company is doing. Finding that whole situation was mostly unintentional, although now I'm looking for similar management vs. short seller face-offs. My original goal was just to find cheaply priced call options. I didn't expect to find a fight in progress. I figured I would share with the community how I did that. If anyone else has a better strategy for finding them I would also love to hear it.

I was getting annoyed at how often the market seems to price call options in such a manner that profiting off of them seems unlikely. I mean it does make sense that the market makers know what they are doing, at least most of the time. So my first thought was stocks with a high short interest, where the market is expecting a drop, could be a place to find cheap calls.

I used this formula to screen for stocks with a high short interest:

Short interest \* Price >= Market Cap \* 0.05

Short interest being the total number of shares sold short multiplied by the share price to get the total dollar amount. Then comparing the dollar amount to the overall market cap.  Screening out stocks with less than 5% short interest when compared to market cap.

I wanted to add another piece though, since while I was looking for cheap call options, I wanted mispricings. Not calls that are cheap because the company is dog shit and dying.

So there's this other formula I like to use:

Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) + Total Receivables (Quarterly) >= Payables and Accrued Expenses (Quarterly) \* 1.2

When the government shut down all the shopping centers in the country because of COVID I got kicked in the balls hard because I owned a debt-heavy Shopping Center REIT that was trying to make a comeback. It went bankrupt. I learned a lesson there. I like that formula since the idea is that the company has enough money to pay its bills for the next year. That would seem common sense but a surprising number of corporations don't.

This yielded good results, but I noticed that if the stock had high short interests and a high PE, it seemed to indicate disagreement in the market about the stock's value, and the call options would be expensive.

So I added PE <= 10 to try and narrow it down to just the stocks that the market is willing to sell call options cheaply on.

Much like Tegna (TGNA) I did find numerous other corporations, including GM, with high short interest that were launching ""accelerated share buybacks""  I guess it's not that uncommon for corporate CEOs to give the middle finger to short sellers. But in a lot of these cases, the options market again, isn't selling calls cheaply.

I'm keeping my eyes peeled for another opportunity where management is fighting short sellers with massive buybacks and the company is of sound financial strength and calls are cheap. I don't only use the one standard for financial strength. After a stock pops up on the screening and I confirm the calls are selling cheaply, I start to dive into their financial statements. Looking at a lot of other things aside from the corporation's ability to pay their bills for the next year.

The professionals seem to know what they are doing most of the time. But boy is it sure delicious when they get it wrong. Especially with retail investors, watching, waiting, and ready to strike.

I am curious if anyone else knows of a good way to find cheaply priced calls. My method is a bit labor intensive and slow for me to do.

\*edit\*

There was a good point the comments, I wanted to add that I also look for stock where the market is selling calls that don't expire for a year or more. Long-term call options.

As I think more about his comment it might also be a good idea to wait for the share buybacks to have gone on for a long time. In the case of TGNA they bought back 25% of their shares last year.

Anyone else work for a car dealer? How we feeling about BBU?,"So, in 2022, Brookfield Business Partners acquired CDK. CDK is a software suite run in 15,000 dealerships across the US. When their servers go down, it affects EVERYONE at the dealer. Service, parts, and sales.

And right now, EVERYONE is down. Many dealerships are not even opening.

Why did this hack occur?

Well, it probably has somethin to do with private equity buying them and 'streamlining,' aka firing off a shitload of people and likely leaving their IT and cybersecurity departments, aka the whole fucking business, running on a skeleton crew.

We currently have no ETA for when our systems will be back up. We've lost two entire days.

Even just in parts and service, that's thousands of dollars in lost revenue every day. If sales is being prevented from moving cars? So much worse.

Lots of rumors are swirling about thos hack being intentional sabotage by ex-employees. I can't speak to that.

But what I can say is that these guys are about to get the fucking shit sued out of them. By the time this is fixed, they're going to be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in lost profits. This company is going to tank.

I am but a humble regard behind the Wendy's dumpster, so I don't really know the move here, I just wanted to get some discussion. But it seems like long puts might be a good idea. This company is shit and their stock has barely even reacted to the hack. I'm not even sure what BBU does outside of CDK; their market cap is similar to what CDK's was when they purchased them.

Their biggest competitor is Reynolds and Reynolds, which is privately owned, and possibly already in financial trouble. That could be their saving grace.

HIMS growth potential,"Hi. First post here on Reddit so please don't flame me.

I am a typical ETF investoer and been doing that for the past 2 years. Will keep on doing that for my retirement (so boring bla bla bla).

Now I am also investing around 10% of my Portfolio into individual stocks and want to do that with some who are already intersting but not in any of the typical etf's to have more diversity in.

I invested a small sum into TOST and NU (will increase that in the next months) but also in HIMS until it became my biggest position in indvidual stocks in the past days. I used the decrease of 11% yesterday to buy more and get the average price of my shares down. I would be happy to have discussion with you and your thoughts about this company.

They gained quite a lot in the past month (18%) bacause of the announcement of offering weight loss medicine which also increased their amount of Instagram followers. I also think that this medicine will increase their revenue quite a lot as their average customer is currently spending 55$ a month and the weight loss subscription will cost between 70-250$ a month. Their next earnings call will probabyly show this increase which will then also show in the stocks.

NVDA's Big Drop in Prices: The True Reason Behind the AI Chip Revolution,"Recently, Anthropic, a small startup with funding 5-6 times smaller than OpenAI, launched their latest model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with performance surpassing OpenAI's flagship GPT-4. Google also quickly released Gemini-1.5-Pro, which swiftly outperformed GPT-4-Turbo. Sounds interesting, but how is this related to NVIDIA? Simply put, both Google and Anthropic use Google's TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) chips to train both of these models. Shortly after OpenAI announced the ""divine"" GPT-4, Anthropic only began to release their first model, Claude-1, which was like a joke compared to the modern GPT-4. Google was even slower in launching Google Bard, later renamed Gemini 1.0, which became a meme, and everyone thought OpenAI would be unbeatable. OpenAI relied on expensive and power-hungry NVIDIA chips, spending $100 million and several years of training to launch an expensive GPT-4 model that most regular free users couldn't access. In less than a year, Anthropic and Google easily surpassed them, launching models superior to GPT-4 at a cost 10 times cheaper, with training costs also 10 times lower and only taking a few months.

The situation with general-purpose GPU chips for AI training is similar to using them for Bitcoin mining in 2014 - expensive, energy-consuming, and wastefully space-occupying, until Bitcoin difficulty increased to the point where NVIDIA GPUs became useless and ASIC Bitcoin miners emerged to replace them. Therefore, thinking that NVIDIA will monopolize the AI chip market is just the thinking of Wall Street traders who only know companies through Bloomberg articles and have no expertise in the field.

Thanks to NVIDIA's expensive and inefficient GPUs, a basic user paying $20/month can still only access GPT-4 in a limited and expensive way, while Google is providing FREE API access to their FLAGSHIP MODEL, Gemini-1.5-Pro. Remember that Claude 3.5 Sonnet isn't even the flagship model, but just an inexpensive mid-tier model. Claude 3.5 Opus will be released and it will surpass GPT-4.5 or even GPT-5 thanks to NOT USING NVIDIA GPUs.

GOING INTO SUMMER IN AN ELECTION YEAR,"You have heard the saying sell in May and go away. That is because the summer months tend to be a rough time for stocks, starting post earnings season in May leaving June flat. However historically you see one of the strongest periods of the year in the first 10 days of July. Then a downturn going into the toughest stretch at the end of July through September.¬† October is typically a great place to bargain hunt for stocks which can be rewarded with the bullish end of year rally going into Nov/Dec.¬†

In an election year the patterns can change. You can have a fairly decent July and bullish August with September selling off. Still leaving October a good time to buy in preparation for a strong post election end of year rally. If the election is contested that could change the dynamic.¬†

Personally I‚Äôve been burned enough times with options in August and Sept that I now tend to preserve capital and take profit when I can going into late July through Sept. Maybe sell some covered calls on my long positions and wait for buying opportunities to arise. ¬†

As far as NVDA goes‚Ä¶who knows what earnings will bring, but we have all seen the upside from NVDA blowing away estimates.¬†

How do people make money from selling options contracts?,"So ive been reading a bunch on this trying to figure out how options trading works. Things such as call or put options.

I feel like im starting to get some things and would like confirmation if im understanding it right. But I also have a follow up question. Possibly explain in the simplest to understand terms.

So say i have $100 dollars.
I can buy 1 share of some stock thats currently worth $100 and down the line if it goes up to $150, sell it for a $50 profit.

But with a call option. For example I can buy a contract for 1$ to have the right to buy 100 shares(which if i understand correctly is the quantity each contract is worth) of that same stock at $125 per share within the next month lets say. So I would have to spend $100 bucks still to buy 100 contracts a dollar each is that correct? It wouldnt be just a dollar for the whole 100 shares, right?
So assuming i paid $100 for this contract. If the price once again goes up to $150, i can buy 100 shares for $125 instead for a total of $12,500 and then sell them for a total of $15,000, netting myself a profit of $2,500 minus the $100 premium i paid and walk away with $2,400. Did i understand all that correctly?


My follow up question to that then stems from seeing that people dont actually exercise their option and instead sell it to someone else at a higher premium.

 ‚Äî 
Boeing‚Äôs Starliner spacecraft was set to mark its crowning achievement this month: Ferrying two NASA astronauts on a round trip to the International Space Station, proving the long-delayed and over-budget capsule is up for the task.

Starliner is halfway to that goal.

But the two veteran astronauts piloting this test flight are now in a tentative position ‚Äî extending their stay aboard the space station for a second time while engineers on the ground scramble to learn more about issues that plagued the first leg of their journey.

Spaceflight veterans Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore arrived at the space station aboard the Starliner on June 6. NASA initially projected their stay would last about a week.

But troubles the vehicle experienced en route, including helium leaks and thrusters that abruptly stopped working, have raised questions about how the back half of the mission will play out.


Williams and Wilmore will now return no earlier than June 26, NASA announced Tuesday, stretching their mission to at least 20 days as engineers race to gain a better understanding of the spacecraft‚Äôs problems while it‚Äôs safely attached to the space station.


Officials have said there is no reason to believe Starliner won‚Äôt be able to bring the astronauts back home, though ‚Äúwe really want to work through the remainder of the data,‚Äù said Steve Stich, NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program manager, at a Tuesday news conference.

The Boeing Starliner spacecraft docks to the International Space Station on June 6, 2024.

Meanwhile, Boeing has sought to frame the mission as a success and learning opportunity, albeit one that has left the Starliner team grappling with the ‚Äúunplanned‚Äù side of the mission, as Mark Nappi, Boeing‚Äôs vice president and program manager of the Starliner program, put it Tuesday.

It‚Äôs not uncommon for astronauts to unexpectedly extend their stay aboard the space station ‚Äî for days, weeks or even months. (NASA has also said the Starliner can spend up to 45 days at the orbiting laboratory if needed, according to Stich.)

But the situation makes for a moment of uncertainty and embarrassment that joins a long list of similar blunders by the Boeing Starliner program, which is already years behind schedule. It also adds to a chorus of unfavorable news that has followed Boeing as a company for some time.

A nail-biting finale
Boeing and NASA engineers said they are opting to leave Starliner ‚Äî and with it, Williams and Wilmore ‚Äî aboard the station longer than expected primarily to carry out additional analysis. The helium leaks and thruster issues occurred on a part of the vehicle that is not intended to survive the trip home from space, so mission teams are delaying the spacecraft‚Äôs return as part of a last-ditch effort to learn everything they can about what went wrong.

Danger looms any time a spacecraft returns home from orbit. It is perhaps the most perilous stretch of any mission to space.

The trip will require the Starliner to hit Earth‚Äôs thick atmosphere while traveling more than 22 times the speed of sound. The process will bake the spacecraft‚Äôs exterior at roughly 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

Then, a set of parachutes ‚Äî which Boeing redesigned and tested as recently as January ‚Äî must safely slow the capsule down before it reaches terra firma. (Starliner will be the first US-made capsule to parachute to a landing on the ground rather than splash down in the ocean. Boeing hopes that approach will make it easier to recover and refurbish the Starliner after flight.)

A series of setbacks
Starliner‚Äôs journey to this historic crewed test mission began in 2014 when NASA tapped both Boeing and SpaceX to develop a spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station.

At the time, Boeing was seen as the stalwart aerospace giant that would likely get the job done first while SpaceX was the unpredictable newcomer.

Over the past decade, however, tides have shifted.


SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon spacecraft safely completed its first crewed mission ‚Äî which appeared to go off without a hitch ‚Äî in 2020. And the vehicle has been regularly flying astronauts and paying customers since.

The two astronauts that piloted Crew Dragon‚Äôs inaugural flight ‚Äî Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley ‚Äî also stayed aboard the space station longer than expected, notching more than 60 days rather than the brief stint expected on such test flights.

But Hurley and Behnken‚Äôs stay was extended so that the astronauts could lend a hand with daily activities aboard the space station, which at the time was understaffed. The extension did not directly relate to specific software or hardware problems with SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon.

Spacecraft issues, on the other hand, have marred Boeing‚Äôs Starliner program practically every step of the way. The vehicle has faced years of delays, setbacks and added expenses that have cost the company more than $1 billion, according to public financial records.

The first Starliner test mission, flown without crew in late 2019, was riddled with missteps. The vehicle misfired in orbit, a symptom of software problems that included a coding error that set an internal clock off by 11 hours.

A second uncrewed flight test in 2022 uncovered additional software issues and trouble with some of the vehicle‚Äôs thrusters.

Stich, the NASA program manager, indicated during a June 6 news conference that it‚Äôs possible engineers may not have completely resolved those issues from 2022.

‚ÄúWe thought we had fixed that problem,‚Äù Stich said, adding, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre missing something fundamental that‚Äôs going on inside the thruster.‚Äù

Michael Lembeck, an aerospace engineering associate professor of practice at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who was a consultant for Boeing‚Äôs spaceflight division from 2009 to 2014, told CNN that it would be difficult to determine whether additional ground tests may have caught the thruster issues at hand.

But Lembeck emphasized that evaluating the success of this test mission is not as simple as comparing it directly with the inaugural crewed test flight of SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon.

Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Starship missions both hit spaceflight milestones this week
For example, he said, SpaceX‚Äôs Dragon cargo capsule ‚Äî a direct predecessor of Crew Dragon ‚Äî completed more than a decade of uncrewed cargo missions to the space station before Crew Dragon took flight.


‚ÄúSpaceX did have a head start with the cargo program,‚Äù Lembeck said. ‚ÄúI think they do have an advantage that Boeing did not have. Boeing‚Äôs kind of having to build a crew vehicle all up from scratch.‚Äù

Should this Starliner test mission encounter additional setbacks, however, it could put Boeing in a situation where it must rely on its rival to get Williams and Wilmore home.

‚ÄúThe embarrassing backup is that a Crew Dragon would have to go and retrieve the astronauts,‚Äù Lembeck said. The spacecraft ‚Äúcould be sent up with two crew members and sent back with four ‚Äî and that would probably be the way home.‚Äù

Boeing‚Äôs broader problems
Boeing executives have repeatedly sought to make clear that the Starliner program operates independently from the company‚Äôs other units ‚Äî including the commercial aircraft division that has been at the center of scandals for years.

‚ÄúWe have humans flying on this vehicle. We always take that so seriously,‚Äù Nappi said during a news briefing in April before Starliner took flight.

Nappi at the time also declared that the Starliner team was operating at ‚Äúpeak performance‚Äù and ‚Äúreally looking forward to executing‚Äù a safe mission.

When asked about that assertion on Tuesday, Stich, the NASA executive, said that officials at Boeing and NASA had always expected to find additional issues that needed to be hashed out during this test flight.


Williams had alluded to that expectation during a pre-flight news conference, saying, ‚ÄúWe always find stuff, and we are going to continually find stuff.

‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs not going to be absolutely perfect as we fly the spacecraft. ‚Ä¶We feel very safe and comfortable with how this spacecraft flies, and we have backup procedures in case we need those,‚Äù Williams said.

Stich, however, acknowledged on Tuesday that Boeing and NASA might have been able to prevent some of the hangups the Starliner has encountered: ‚ÄúPerhaps we could have done different testing on the

"Why the yesterday's selloff, my list","1. Sp500 hit 5500, the same way NVDA sold off on March 7th when it hit 5250

2. Important smaller indexes/ETFs hit their upper bound in terms of price and RSI:  
-SOXX at 256 hit two trendlines, and daily RSI14 75 above which it gets only once a year or so,   
-PHLX SOX hit RSI 78 at which it always corrects  
-XLK hit major TL since X 22 and rsi of 80,5. Strangely Accenture results must have thrown it over the edge.  
-Nasdaq Composite: upper bound of a recent trendline (since mid May) and RSI of 80 at which it has always corrected except 2010,17,18 in the last 15 years.

3. XLK rebalancing > selling the news (it's just 12% of average daily turnover and I see many people misunderstood how it's spread)

4. AAII and II sentiment indicator became borderline

5. Too many brag posts about NVDA on WSB/IG/random news.

6. For too many data center/semis stock the same indicators became way out of line or right on the extreme edge (MU!)

6B. Also many tech stocks, esp. those more volatile and the whole Communication segment was in downward trend for a few weeks/months now

7. Ten year yield is below it's trendline since X 23 > ready to rebound

8. Crude brent got above it's resistance at $84.25 / rsi 60 -> ready to soar

9.  DXY Dollar index could go either way the day before but decided to go upwards.

10. Very interesting if you looked at the open interest in the morning how artificially the price was held up at 139.9x and then... boom!

Personally was hoping for NVDA to get maybe to 1499, therefore sold at 137.75 to 139.

People who are playing stocks other than NVDA. Why? ,"We are in the midst of a once in a decade bull run of a stock that just keeps going up and up and up. Peop

It reminds me of that scene from moneyball where the scouts are trying to replace Jeremy giambi. To which Brad Pitt says ""Is there another player like Giambi""? 

So why is anyone trying to play any other stock? Are those more profitable, even in short term, intraday trades? 

People who are downvoting - please don't. I'm not selling nvda here. I'm here to make money, not to be loyal to some stock. And I'm genuinely curious.

"My Thesis on IonQ
","Hey there! So, I've been looking into IonQ and it's pretty exciting stuff. Let me fill you in on why it might be a smart investment compared to something like NVIDIA, which has already had a big run-up in stock price.

# Stock Performance

First off, IonQ's stock has been all over the place lately. It hit a high of $21.58 last September but has since settled around $7.55. This kind of volatility can be nerve-wracking, but it's also where the potential for big gains lies. Analysts think it could go up to between $11.50 and $21.00, so there‚Äôs definitely room for growth.

# What's New with IonQ?

IonQ just hit a major milestone way ahead of schedule: their #AQ 35 benchmark. This basically means their quantum computers can handle really complex problems, and they're getting better at it faster than expected. The market loved this news, and it‚Äôs a big reason why people are optimistic about their stock.

# Management Changes

They‚Äôve also made some smart moves with their leadership. Peter Chapman is now the Chairman of the Board, and Stacey Giamalis is the new Chief Legal Officer. These are seasoned pros who are expected to drive the company‚Äôs strategy and growth. Plus, they‚Äôve teamed up with big names like Oak Ridge National Laboratory to work on cool projects like improving the US power grid with quantum tech.

# Industry Positioning

IonQ is the only quantum computing company available on all the major cloud platforms‚ÄîAmazon Braket, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This means they‚Äôre super accessible and have a wide reach across different industries like logistics, finance, and even pharma. They're not just in the game; they're making big plays.

# Financials

Financially, IonQ is looking solid. They made $7.6 million in Q1 2024, which is a 77% increase from last year. They‚Äôve got a lot of cash on hand‚Äî$434.4 million‚Äîso they‚Äôre in a good position to keep pushing their tech forward. Sure, they reported a net loss of $39.6 million, but that's pretty typical for a company investing heavily in its future.

# Why IonQ Over NVIDIA?

Now, why consider IonQ over NVIDIA? Well, NVIDIA is a giant in the GPU and AI market, and their stock has already skyrocketed. If you‚Äôre looking for something with high growth potential, IonQ might be the way to go. Here‚Äôs why:

1. **Early-Stage Growth**: IonQ is still in the early stages of its growth, whereas NVIDIA is more established. This means there's more potential for IonQ's stock to take off as quantum computing becomes more mainstream.
2. **Quantum Leap**: Quantum computing is set to revolutionize many industries, and IonQ is leading the charge. NVIDIA is great, but they‚Äôre not in the quantum space the way IonQ is.
3. **Valuation**: IonQ‚Äôs stock is relatively undervalued compared to NVIDIA‚Äôs, giving you a better entry point if you believe in the long-term potential of quantum computing.

In summary, IonQ is at the cutting edge of a transformative technology. Their recent achievements, strategic leadership changes, and strong financial position make them a compelling investment opportunity, especially compared to more mature companies like NVIDIA. If you're looking for something with high potential and are okay with a bit of risk, IonQ could be a smart move.",1718917643.0,hey looking ionq pretty exciting stuff let fill might smart investment compared something like nvidia already big run stock price stock performance first ionq stock place lately hit high 21 58 last september since settled around 7 55 kind volatility nerve wracking also potential big gains lies analysts think could go 11 50 21 00 definitely room growth new ionq ionq hit major milestone way ahead schedule aq 35 benchmark basically means quantum computers handle really complex problems getting better faster expected market loved news big reason people optimistic stock management changes also made smart moves leadership peter chapman chairman board stacey giamalis new chief legal officer seasoned pros expected drive company strategy growth plus teamed big names like oak ridge national laboratory work cool projects like improving us power grid quantum tech industry positioning ionq quantum computing company available major cloud platforms amazon braket microsoft azure google cloud means super accessible wide reach across different industries like logistics finance even pharma game making big plays financials financially ionq looking solid made 7 6 million q1 2024 77 increase last year got lot cash hand 434 4 million good position keep pushing tech forward sure reported net loss 39 6 million pretty typical company investing heavily future ionq nvidia consider ionq nvidia well nvidia giant gpu ai market stock already skyrocketed looking something high growth potential ionq might way go 1 early stage growth ionq still early stages growth whereas nvidia established means potential ionq stock take quantum computing becomes mainstream 2 quantum leap quantum computing set revolutionize many industries ionq leading charge nvidia great quantum space way ionq 3 valuation ionq stock relatively undervalued compared nvidia giving better entry point believe long term potential quantum computing summary ionq cutting edge transformative technology recent achievements strategic leadership changes strong financial position make compelling investment opportunity especially compared mature companies like nvidia looking something high potential okay bit risk ionq could smart move,0.9981,2024-06-20

AAL,"OK so this is purely speculative, but is anyone else following the flight attendant labor negotiations at American Airlines? On June 5 the flight attendants union rejected a pay offer. Said they were meeting for one more week as a last ditch effort. They are prepared to strike, but have to be released from mediation first. Obviously a flight attendant strike during peak travel season would be crushing to AAL in the short term.

It‚Äôs now June 20, and there have been no updates since. Maybe that means negotiations are actually making progress. I‚Äôm not sure how much the threat of striking is built in to the current share price- I would think that a deal getting done would cause at least a small pop in price.

If there is a strike though, I‚Äôd expect a pretty sharp (short term drop). Right now I have small positions (even smaller after today) in both otm calls and puts. Need to do some more DD and will increase my position accordingly. 

DD to follow. Specifically I‚Äôm going to look at share price activity during/after the pilot labor negotiations last year.

>At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?
